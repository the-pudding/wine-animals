How do we tell?"}]},{"block":[{"type":"text","value":"This line represents all 217 cats we found. 161 of them were heraldic lions, so this is basically their graph."}]},{"block":[{"type":"text","value":"Compare the cat line to the gray lines in the background.

So anything underwater is a pretty safe bet."}]},{"block":[{"type":"text","value":"This isn’t to say good wines have fish on them – in fact, fish didn’t score a single entry above the high bar of 4.5 stars.

Sure, you can find a $25, 4-star mythical creature. But if you had to guess the price of a unicorn, it’s just as likely to be a hundred dollars as it is forty. Maybe the price is worth it, though, as mythical creatures were reserved for the good stuff: only one entry below a 3.5."}]},{"block":[{"type":"text","value":"Mythical creatures had the steepest overall curve of any category, but something interesting happens around the $35 mark. Up until this point, they’re actually a great signpost – not a single entry above the line. But past $35, the majority of entries shift above the line, indicating that they’re overvalued. The problem is, if you’re just looking for a good buy, you’ll have to sift through all the mythical creatures at the top end of that spectrum."}]},{"block":[{"type":"text","value":"But what if you want to ball out?

Maybe owls, as well."}]},{"block":[{"type":"text","value":"In the end, one bottle had to emerge victorious. Looking at the entire graph, and focussing on the bottom-right corner, a few bottles stand out as great deals.
