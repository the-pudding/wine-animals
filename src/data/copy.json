Are the “classic” animals – your stags, horses and lions – truly priced higher than everything else?"},{"type":"text","value":"As we’ll see, there are patterns and exceptions.

A much more useful thing to know is which animals are undervalued, the ones that tend to stay cheap, even as quality increases."},{"type":"text","value":"For that, we turn to the data."},{"type":"text","value":"We scraped 10,000 wines off the popular app Vivino and tabulated results from there.

Some big, some small, some strange: a truly diverse range of creatures."},{"type":"text","value":"Oh – and we set the graph’s upper limit at $150, so there’s no bionic frog in the mix. We figured that if you’re spending more than $150 on a bottle of wine, you’re probably not choosing based on the label anyway."}]}
