{"id":"175001630","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "LORENZO MELANI" and "Brunello Di Montalcino" along with the year 2017. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label itself. The photograph seems to be taken outdoors with a slightly blurred background where some objects and possibly parts of people can be seen around a table, indicative of a social gathering. I am very certain, so I would rate this 1, that there are no animals or humans depicted on the wine label itself.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
