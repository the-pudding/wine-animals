{"id":"171283922","responseA":"In the image, there's no actual animal or human depicted. However, the label features an illustration of a grapevine that is anthropomorphized to resemble a human figure, with the grapevine branches extending outward like arms and bunches of grapes that could be associated with hands or fruit held by hands. The stylized drawing gives this effect even though it's a plant, not a real person. I'm certain about this interpretation (1 on your scale).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
