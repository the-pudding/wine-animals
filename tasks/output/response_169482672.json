{"id":"169482672","responseA":"The image appears to be a close-up of a wine label featuring the name "Casafranca" and "Andrea Formilli Fendi" on the bottle. There is an illustration of what looks like a country house or villa on the label. I do not see any animals or humans depicted on the label other than the artistic representation of the residence. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
