{"id":"169199661","responseA":"There is a stylized depiction of a human figure on the wine label. The figure appears to be a mermaid, which is a mythological creature with the upper body of a human and the tail of a fish. I am certain that this is a designed illustration and not a real person or animal. My certainty level is 1, as it is clear that this is an artistic representation meant for branding purposes.","responseB":"{"animal": "mermaid", "certainty": 1}"}
