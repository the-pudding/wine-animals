{"id":"159575211","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "Beaune 1er Cru Champs Pimont" indicating it's a premier cru wine from Beaune, which is a region in Burgundy, France. The label also includes the name "Domaine Clos de la Chapelle," suggesting the producer or winery, and indicates a specific bottling number with "1440 bouteilles récoltées" which translates to "1440 bottles harvested."There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; rather, there's an illustration that seems to represent a building or estate which may be associated with the winery. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
