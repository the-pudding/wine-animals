{"id":"175478254","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the word "Verha" and the descriptor "Rosso" on it, indicating it is a red wine. The label also includes the word "Basilicata," suggesting the wine is from the Basilicata region in Italy, known for its wine production. The label's design includes colorful circles, which appear like ink splatters or wine drops, but there are no animals or humans depicted. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
