{"id":"2209500","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the name "N.S. DELLA NEVE" and it states that the wine is a "METODO CLASSICO EXTRA BRUT". Below that, there is the name of the producer "G.D. VAJRA" and the location "BAROLO - ITALIA". At the center top part of the label, there appears to be a graphic design of wings, likely implying a bird or angelic wings. However, there are no full depictions of animals or humans. On a scale from 0 to 1 regarding certainty, I would say my certainty is 1, because the image is clear, and the graphics and text on the label are quite legible with no animals or humans depicted.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
