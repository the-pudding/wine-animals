{"id":"165208888","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Solomon Hills Chardonnay" from Santa Maria Valley. There are no animals or humans visible on the label; it features a drawing of a vineyard with rows of vines, a small house, and a structure that resembles a lighthouse in the background, set against a landscape of rolling hills. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
