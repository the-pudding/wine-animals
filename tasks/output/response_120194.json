{"id":"120194","responseA":"The image on the wine label looks like it includes stylized representations of animals as part of a crest or coat of arms, centered at the top of the label. These animals look heraldic in nature, which is common in traditional European symbolism. They are not real animals but rather artistic renditions that may symbolize certain qualities or a family lineage. As for humans, there are no distinct or clear images of humans on the label. My certainty level for this statement is 1, as this can be determined from the context and the styling of graphics on wine labels.","responseB":"{"animal": "heraldic animals","certainty": 1}"}
