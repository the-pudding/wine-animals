{"id":"169132394","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for 'RUCA MALEN.' It is a Malbec wine from Mendoza, Argentina. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. The design is quite simple and modern with a combination of a textured background and both serif and sans-serif typography enclosed within a geometric shape. I am 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
