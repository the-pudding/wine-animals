{"id":"163358313","responseA":"Based on the image, I see a coat of arms at the top that appears to include a bee or similar insect in the design. There is also a probable depiction of a lion above the bee, which is a common element in heraldry. However, there are no real animals or humans depicted in the image; these are stylized symbols. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "bee, lion", "certainty": 1}"}
