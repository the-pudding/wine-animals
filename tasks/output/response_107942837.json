{"id":"107942837","responseA":"The image appears to be a close-up photo of a wine bottle with a label. The label indicates the wine is from "Château Falfas," which suggests it is a product from a winery by that name. The region mentioned on the label is "Côtes de Bourg," which is an appellation located in Bordeaux, France. I don't detect any clear and definitive representation of animals or humans on the label. There seems to be a decorative emblem or crest that may contain some stylistic elements, but it's not explicitly an animal or human figure. Therefore, on a scale from 0-1 regarding the certainty of the presence of animals or humans on this label, I would rate it as 0, not certain at all.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0}"}
