{"id":"170097168","responseA":"Sorry, the image is a bit blurry, which makes it difficult to identify specific details accurately. From what is visible, there don't appear to be any clear images of animals or humans on it. However, given the quality of the image, my certainty is lower than it would be for a clearer picture. I would rate my certainty about not seeing any animals or humans on the label at around 0.5, considering the blur may be obscuring finer details.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
