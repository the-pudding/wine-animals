{"id":"163344660","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. It features text that includes the name of the wine, "Friendly Gr√ºner Veltliner," and the brand, "LAURENZ V.," along with an indication that it is produced in Austria. There is also a graphic element which appears to be a stylized letter "L" or a simple graphic rather than an animal or human. I am very certain (1) that there are no images of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
