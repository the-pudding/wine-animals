{"id":"173734300","responseA":"The label appears to have illustrations of fanciful creatures which are not specifically identifiable as real animals or humans; they seem to be more caricature or cartoon representations. Some of them might be influenced by animal-like shapes, but they are not realistic depictions of actual animals. My certainty level is at 1 for these observations, as I can clearly see what is depicted on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
