{"id":"162222746","responseA":"The image displays a wine label that has a detailed illustration consisting of a landscape with trees and a building, likely representing a vineyard or estate. To the top left of the label, there is a small emblem that includes a figure which appears to be an animal, resembling a horse or similar creature. There are no visible human figures.
