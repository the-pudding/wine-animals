{"id":"3753912","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that includes some artwork. The label reads "TWO HANDS FOR LOVE OR MONEY CANE CUT SEMILLON BAROSSA VALLEY WINE OF AUSTRALIA". The artwork on the label is not very clear, but it appears to include an illustration or photograph, and I can discern the impression of a human hand. However, no distinct animals or clear images of humans are visible in this picture. My certainty level that there are no clear images of animals or humans visible is 1 (very certain).","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
