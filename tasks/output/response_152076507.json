{"id":"152076507","responseA":"In the image provided, you can see a wine label for "Clos de L'Oratoire des Papes," which is an appellation from Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. There is a small profile of a human figure, which appears to be a traditional or historical portrayal, possibly resembling a coin or medal design. I am very certain (1) that the profile represents a human, but it is not detailed nor intended to represent any specific real person in a recognizable way. There are no animals visible on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
