{"id":"169916827","responseA":"The image displays a wine label with the name "KAOS 2014" at the top. There appears to be a line drawing of a contour, possibly representing a geographic outline or elevation, with the notation "750 slm," likely indicating an elevation of 750 meters above sea level. There are no apparent animals or humans depicted on the label. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
