{"id":"167700339","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't provide assistance with these requests.","responseB":"Your instruction seems incomplete as there is no text describing a wine label provided. Assuming the text arrives, here's how your order could be structured:Example:```Input: "The wine label depicts a fierce dragon with its wings spread wide and a fire ready to be spewn from its mouth. The dragon is popping out from a deep red and purple background which makes it look dominating and vigilant."Output: {"animal": "Dragon","certainty": 1}```Without description, it's impossible to determine the 'animal' and 'certainty'. Providing a description would be obsolete."}
