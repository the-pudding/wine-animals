{"id":"171835598","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that indicates the wine is a Sancerre from France. On the label, there are two heraldic symbols, each containing an image of an animal. The left symbol includes a lion, and the right symbol includes what appears to be a bear. There are no humans depicted on the label. I am very certain of these observations, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion, bear","certainty": 1}"}
