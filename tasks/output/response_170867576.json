{"id":"170867576","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features text and graphic elements such as stars and a crescent moon. The text reads "Furlani, Maddie, Vino Rosso," which indicates that this is a red wine bottle, with "Furlani" likely being the producer's name and "Maddie" possibly being the name of the wine or a specific line of wines. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
