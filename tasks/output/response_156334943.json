{"id":"156334943","responseA":"I don't detect any animals or humans on this image of a wine label. It features the name of the wine, "Tour Prignac Grande Réserve", along with the region "Médoc" and some other text. The central graphic represents a château, which is typical for wine labels, especially for those originating from regions with a strong wine-making heritage like Médoc in France. I am very certain about this observation – so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
