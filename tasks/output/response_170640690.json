The label includes a design that appears to be grapevines or grapes, which is common imagery associated with wine. Aside from the text and the plant design, there are no animals or humans visible on this label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
