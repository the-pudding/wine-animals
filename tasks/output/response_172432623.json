{"id":"172432623","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from Chile named "VANIDOSO." The label indicates that the wine is made from Chardonnay grapes from the D.O. Valle Central and is handpicked. There is also a mention that wild yeast is not used and there's an affirmation that it tastes like grapes. The wine is from the 2020 vintage. I do not see any animals or humans on this label. I am very certain (1) that there are no images of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
