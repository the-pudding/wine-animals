{"id":"168682802","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is primarily text with decorative patterns around the edges. The text on the label describes the wine, indicating the year (2013), the type of wine (Riesling), the region (Rheingau), and the producer (Weingut Robert Weil). There is also a mention of "Tradition," which possibly refers to the winemaking style. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would be at a 1 regarding my certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
