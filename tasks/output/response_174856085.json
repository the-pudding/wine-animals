The label is focused on text that provides information about the wine, such as its type (Anjou Blanc), the appellation (Appellation Anjou Contrôlée), the name Pascal Biotteau, and an indication of the vintner's location (Vigneron a Saint-Jean-des-Mauvrets) along with a signature that seems to read "Mary Taylor."","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
