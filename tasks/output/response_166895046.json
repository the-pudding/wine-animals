{"id":"166895046","responseA":"Based on the provided image, I can confirm that there are no animals or humans depicted on the wine label. The label is text-based with a clean and classic design, typical for wine bottles. It features the name of the winery, the type of wine, and the region it comes from. It appears to be of a high-quality product, as indicated by the terms "Grand Vin de Bourgogne," which means "Great Wine of Burgundy" in French. I am very certain of this assessmentâ€”on a scale from 0 to 1, I would be at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
