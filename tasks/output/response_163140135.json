{"id":"163140135","responseA":"The label of the wine bottle features an illustration of people. These individuals appear to be engaging in some outdoor activity, perhaps associated with winemaking given the context of the wine label. The people in the illustration seem to be wearing hats and casual clothing, indicative of a warm and informal setting. There are no animals visible in this image. I'm very certain about the presence of human figures in the artwork; therefore, on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
