{"id":"2606665","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with a graphic of a tower (presumably part of a ch√¢teau). On top of the tower, there is a small figure that appears to be a lion or similar mythological creature, as it is depicted with a curly mane.

I am very certain (1) of this observation.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
