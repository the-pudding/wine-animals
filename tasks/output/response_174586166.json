{"id":"174586166","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. It only features text which seems to identify the type of wine and its origin. Specifically, it reads "#GVLITAT GRÜNER VELTLINER LITER AUSTRIA," likely indicating an Austrian Grüner Veltliner wine sold in liter bottles. My certainty level is 1, as there are only words with no images of animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
