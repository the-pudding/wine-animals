{"id":"170715703","responseA":"The image you've provided is of a wine label for "Chablis" wine. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. The design features text and a graphic that seems to be a stylized representation of a vine or a shell-like spiral pattern, but it does not resemble any specific animal or human. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
