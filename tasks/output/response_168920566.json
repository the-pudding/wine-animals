{"id":"168920566","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Fuente Grulla." Based on this view, there are no clear depictions of animals or humans on the visible part of the label. It appears to feature some kind of landscape or natural elements, but the details are not entirely clear. Since the image is limited to the label's visible portion, my certainty that there are no animals or humans depicted on this section of the label is 1. However, since the entire label is not visible, there could be additional artwork not shown in this view.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
