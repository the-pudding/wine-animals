{"id":"169533314","responseA":"The image shows a label from a bottle of wine. The main text reads "CIBELES" followed by "TEMPRANILLO RIOJA" and "DENOMINACION DE ORIGEN CALIFICADA RIOJA ALTA" below which indicates the type of wine and its region of origin. There is a detailed sketch of a landscape that includes vineyards, trees, and what appears to be a settlement or town with buildings in the distance. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. I am very certain about this (1 on the scale).","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
