{"id":"167638762","responseA":"The label on the wine bottle features an illustration of humans. These are depicted in a classical style, similar to Renaissance artwork, featuring figures with wings, which could be interpreted as angels or mythical beings. I am very certain about the presence of human-like figures on the label, so I would rate my certainty as 1. There do not appear to be any real animals depicted with certainty, although the winged figures may have some stylistic elements that are reminiscent of animals, such as bird-like wings. My certainty about the absence of actual animals is also 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
