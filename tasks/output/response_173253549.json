{"id":"173253549","responseA":"In the image provided, there appears to be a stylized representation of a human figure on the wine label, which is fashioned in a mosaic-like design. The figure seems to be holding some grapes. There are no obvious animals present in the label's design. My certainty level for this observation would be 1, as the depiction of the human figure is clear and purposeful as part of the label's artwork.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
