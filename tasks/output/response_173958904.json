{"id":"173958904","responseA":"The image features a label with the phrase "FREE YOUR MIND" prominently displayed at the top. There is a stylized graphic of a human head in profile view with what appears to be a flame or similar element where the brain would be, in a contrasting red color. Below the head, there is text that reads "LITE" in a script font, followed by additional text that likely provides information about the wine, although the specific details (such as the type of wine and vintage) are not fully legible in this image. The background of the label is white, and the primary color of the text and graphics is blue, with the exception of the red flame-like element.Based on the information present, I can confirm there is a human-like graphic, not an actual photograph or realistic illustration of a human. I am certain (1.0 on the scale) that the image is a drawn graphic representation on a label and not a depiction of real animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1.0}"}
