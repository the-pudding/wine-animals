{"id":"156697356","responseA":"The image features a wine label that reads "Ashbourne" for a Sauvignon Blanc Chardonnay wine from South Africa. The label has ornate decorations, with stylized artistic elements and patterns, common in wine label design. I see that there are birds depicted on the label as part of the designâ€”these are the animals present. There are no humans on the label. My certainty level about the presence of animals (birds) on the label is 1, as they are clearly depicted in the artwork of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "birds", "certainty": 1}"}
