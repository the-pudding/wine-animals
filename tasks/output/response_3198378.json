{"id":"3198378","responseA":"I see an image of a person in the center of the wine label. They appear to be a stylized, possibly mythological figure due to their size in relation to the vines, which suggests a non-literal representation. There are no animals visible on the label. My certainty level is 1, as the image is clear and the figure is distinctly human in form.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
