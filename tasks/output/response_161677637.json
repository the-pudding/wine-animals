{"id":"161677637","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the text "CLAU DE NELL" and "Cuv√©e Violette ANNE CLAUDE LEFLAIVE." There are botanical illustrations, possibly grape vines or another type of plant, around the edges of the label. There do not appear to be any animals or human figures on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
