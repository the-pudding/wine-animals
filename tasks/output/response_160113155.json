{"id":"160113155","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that has some symbolic graphics and text but does not depict any real animals or humans. The design in the center appears to be a stylized symbol that may resemble wings, possibly referencing the caduceus, which is associated with the Greek god Hermes. I am very certain that there are no real animals or humans visible on this label, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
