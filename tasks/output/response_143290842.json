{"id":"143290842","responseA":"There is a depiction of people on the wine label; you can see small figures that appear to be humans in the landscape scene. These figures seem to be engaged in activities that could be associated with vineyard work, such as tending to the vines or perhaps walking through the fields. I am about 0.8 certain of the presence of these figures, because while the illustration is quite small and detailed, the context of the image on a wine label makes it likely that the figures represent people working in a vineyard.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 0.8}"}
