{"id":"176359808","responseA":"The wine label features an image of a human figure, which appears to be a cherub or a putto â€“ a representation commonly found in art and associated with classical iconography. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1. There are no real animals depicted in the image, but there are illustrations of grapevines entwined around the label, which is common for wine labels as they symbolize the origin of the product.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
