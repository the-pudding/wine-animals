{"id":"175063780","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request.","responseB":"Apologies for the confusion, but as an AI model, I need a specific wine label description to complete the task. Once you provide a description, I can give you the structured information in 'animal' and 'certainty' format. For instance, let's say you provide a wine label description like "This wine label showcases a flying dove against a sunset backdrop." Based on this, the return could be:{"animal": "dove","certainty": 1}Please provide a wine label description and I will be happy to help."}
