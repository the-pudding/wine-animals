{"id":"175408149","responseA":"The image you've provided is of a wine label for "TANGENT PINOT GRIS." There are no discernible images of animals or humans on the label; it features an abstract, geometric design with what appears to be watercolor-style sections in varying shades of purple, pink, and blue.
