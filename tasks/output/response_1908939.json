{"id":"1908939","responseA":"I do not detect any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is focused on text and branding elements, which include the name of the wine, the type of appellation, and the producer, as well as some details on the method and classification. The ornate design at the top appears to be a crest or coat of arms, which is typical for wine labels and does not depict any living creatures. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
