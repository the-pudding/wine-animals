{"id":"171700149","responseA":"On the wine label, there is a drawing that seems to include stylized trees or a landscape. There are no clear images of animals or humans. I cannot discern any definitive figures that would suggest a living creature. Therefore, it does not seem there are depictions of animals or humans on this label. My certainty is 1, as I can clearly see the entire label and the drawing does not appear to contain animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
