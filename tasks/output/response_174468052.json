{"id":"174468052","responseA":"This is an image of a wine bottle with a label that reads "TIEFENBRUNNER Turmhof LAGREIN SÃœDTIROL - ALTO ADIGE". There is a decorative crest in the center of the label which features a bird, possibly an eagle, at the very top of the design. The crest may be a heraldic symbol, often used to represent a family, place, or winery's heritage. I am very certain, with a confidence level of 1, that there are no photographs of real people or animals on the label and that the bird depicted is a stylized graphic element of the label's design.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
