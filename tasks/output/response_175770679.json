{"id":"175770679","responseA":"The label on the bottle doesn't clearly depict any animals or humans. The central image appears to show an inanimate object, possibly related to wine production or the geographical area of the wine's origin, but no distinct figures of animals or humans can be identified. My certainty in this case is 1, as I can confidently say that the label does not prominently feature any animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
