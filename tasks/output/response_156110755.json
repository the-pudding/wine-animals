{"id":"156110755","responseA":"The image is of a wine label that reads "Clos des Menuts Saint-Emilion Grand Cru, Famille Rivi√®re Depuis 1875." At the bottom of the label, there is a small circular seal or emblem that appears to feature a small figure, which could be a stylized representation of a person. However, the image is not clear enough for me to definitively state the nature of this figure, and no animals are discernible. Therefore, on the scale from 0 to 1 regarding certainty, I would rate my certainty as 0.5 due to the lack of clarity.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.5}"}
