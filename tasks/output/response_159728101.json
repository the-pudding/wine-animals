{"id":"159728101","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on this wine label; it features an illustration of a building possibly a chateau, which is associated with the name of the wine "Château Calet." There is also text indicating that it is a "Grand Vin de Bordeaux," from the "Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux" region and that the vineyards are Bayle-Carreau. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale from 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
