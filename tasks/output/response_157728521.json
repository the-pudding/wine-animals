{"id":"157728521","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label depicts text, which includes the brand name "Mengoba las Tinajas," the name "Gregory Perez," and some information about the wine itself, such as the bottle size (75cl) and the alcohol content (11.5% vol). There are also graphical elements that look like two clay pots or containers, which are indicative of traditional wine storage or fermentation vessels, known as "tinajas" in Spanish. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 is 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
