{"id":"171650557","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with the name "Blackbird Vineyards Dissonance". There are bird silhouettes on some branches, which count as animal images. There are no human figures visible on the label. I am very certain about the presence of animal imagery and the absence of human figures in this image, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
