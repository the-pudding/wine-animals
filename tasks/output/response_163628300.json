{"id":"163628300","responseA":"The label shows a graphic emblem that might be interpreted as a stylized animal, possibly a depiction of a bird with its wings spread, but the image is abstract. The certainty about whether this is intentionally an animal and what type of animal it is meant to represent can be quite low because it relies on subjective interpretation. My certainty level is around 0.3. Would you like to know more about wine labels or this particular style of graphics?","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 0.3}"}
