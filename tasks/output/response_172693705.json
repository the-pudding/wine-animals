{"id":"172693705","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "The Valley Chardonnay." There do not appear to be any animals or humans depicted on the label; it features text and an illustration of a landscape, presumably a valley which is relevant to the branding of the wine. I am very certain that there are no animals or humans present on this label, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
