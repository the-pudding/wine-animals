{"id":"164077740","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that features an intricate illustration. The drawing is of a landscape depicting a walled city or fortress with buildings within it, apparently a representation of the "Cité de Carcassonne," which is a historical fortress in southern France. Above the illustration, the name "Pierre" is prominent, likely denoting the brand or producer of the wine, and "tailleur de vins," which translates to "wine tailor" or "winemaker," is written underneath. The label indicates that this is a bottle of "Sauvignon Blanc," a popular type of white wine, from the indicated geographical protection (IGP) region "Cité de Carcassonne." The vintage year presented is 2017.I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label, it purely seems to focus on the landscape and architectural elements of the fortress city. I am very certain about this observation, so on the scale you provided, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
