{"id":"172774398","responseA":"The image is quite blurry, so it's difficult to make out specific details on the wine label. I do not see any clear or distinct representations of animals or humans on this portion of the label. Given the image quality and the visible portion of the label, I would say with a certainty level of about 0.7 that there are no animals or humans depicted; however, the certainty is not absolute due to the image quality and the limited view of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.7}"}
