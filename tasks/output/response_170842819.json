{"id":"170842819","responseA":"I see an illustration of an animal on this wine label – specifically, a rabbit holding a glass of wine and what appears to be a grape bunch. The illustration is whimsical and stylized rather than a realistic depiction of an animal. I am very certain this is an illustrated rabbit as indicated by its long ears and characteristic facial features – certainty level 1. There are no real humans or real animals in this image, just the drawing of the rabbit.","responseB":"{  "animal": "rabbit",  "certainty": 1}"}
