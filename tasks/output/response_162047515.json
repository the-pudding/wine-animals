{"id":"162047515","responseA":"This image displays a bottle with a wine label from "TOKOÄ“KA Estate". The label features an illustration of what appears to be an animal, specifically a bird, given the detail of feathers visible on the head. There are no humans or other types of animals visible on the label. I am very certain about the presence of the illustrated animal on the label, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
