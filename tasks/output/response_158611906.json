{"id":"158611906","responseA":"The label on the wine bottle features what appears to be a landscape illustration with no discernable animals or humans. Focusing on the visible part of the illustration, it primarily showcases vineyards and a building which could be part of the winery. Considering it is a still image of a label, I am very certain—my certainty level is 1—that there are no animals or humans depicted in this portion of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
