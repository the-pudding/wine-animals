{"id":"176489525","responseA":"The image you've provided is of a wine label that reads "morphos" and is described as a PÃ©tillant Naturel American Sparkling Wine by Oyster River Winegrowers. The label features a whimsical design with various patterns and illustrations including plant-like doodles. However, it does not clearly depict any animals or humans.Regarding the scale of certainty between 0 and 1, without the ability to conduct an analysis specifically aimed at detecting animals or humans, I can only say that there is no obvious representation of an animal or human on the visible part of the label. Thus, I would rate my certainty at 0.95, leaving a small margin due to the abstract nature of the illustrations which could potentially hide such figures in the intricate design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.95}"}
