{"id":"168295491","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label with an abstract artistic design. The label includes the text "Das ist keine Orange," which is German for "This is not an orange." There is a stylized circular form that could be interpreted as an abstract representation of an orange with a small leaf or similar element at the top, but there are no clear depictions of animals or humans. I am very certain of this assessment; on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
