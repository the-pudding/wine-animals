{"id":"171697927","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with no visible animals or humans present. The label indicates it is for a "Chianti Classico Riserva," which is a type of Italian wine from the Chianti region, known to be held to strict quality standards. There are stylish ornamental designs around the edges, and the word "OTELO" is present on a separate part of the label, likely referring to the brand or name of the specific wine. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans on the label is 1, as only text and decorative elements are visible.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
