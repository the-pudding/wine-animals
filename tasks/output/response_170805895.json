{"id":"170805895","responseA":"There do not appear to be any animals or humans depicted on this wine label itself. The design is text-based with the name "CHATXO" prominently featured, alongside the indication that it is a wine from the "RIOJA ALAVESA" region, and it has a "DENOMINACIÃ“N DE ORIGEN CALIFICADA." There is a small emblem to the right, but it is not detailed enough to make out from this image if there are any animals or humans within it. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
