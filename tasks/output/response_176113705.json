{"id":"176113705","responseA":"The image depicts two animated characters on a wine label. One appears to be a stylized, humanoid version of a mythical creature often known as a "chupacabra," and the other is an anthropomorphic goat. Both characters are portrayed in a cartoonish style, and there are no real animals or humans present on the label. I am certain at a level of 1 that these are just illustrated characters and not actual living beings.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
