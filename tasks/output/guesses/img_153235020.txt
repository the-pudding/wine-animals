I don't see any animals on the wine label. The label appears quite minimalistic, with only text indicating the brand name "TÃ¡bula", and the region of origin, "Ribera del Duero", which is a renowned wine-producing area in Spain. There are no illustrations or images of animals visible on the label as presented in the image.
