I do not see any animals on this wine label. The image depicts a pastoral scene featuring a barn-like structure with trees in the background. The label is for "Biddle Ranch Vineyard," indicating a Chardonnay wine from the Edna Valley. The artwork on the label does not include any visible animals; it focuses primarily on the building and surrounding vegetation.
