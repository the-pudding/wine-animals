The image shows a bottle of wine with the label "GAMBA Vineyards and Winery". On the label, the wine is identified as "Zinfandel" from "Family Ranches Russian River Valley" with an alcohol content of 15.7% by volume. There do not appear to be any animals depicted on the visible parts of the label. The design features elegant script and decorative elements, but no animal imagery is discernible from this view. I am quite sure there are no animals on the part of the label we can see.
