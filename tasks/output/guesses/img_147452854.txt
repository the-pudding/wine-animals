In the image provided, I do not see any animals present on the wine label. The label for "Gemma di Luna Moscato" features a design with a circular pattern that appears to be made of diamond or gemstone illustrations, without any animal imagery. My statement is based on the visible content of the image, and I am confident that there are no animals depicted in this particular picture.
