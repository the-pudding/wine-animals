I do not see any animals on this wine label. The label shows text that reads "Edizione Cinque Autoctoni" and below it "FANTINI." There is an image of a building, likely an estate, depicted at the top of the label. It is all very indicative of a typical wine label without any animal imagery present. I am quite sure there are no animals depicted on this label.
