I don't see any animals depicted on the wine label you shared. The label is quite straightforward and features text with information about the wine, including the name "CHATEAU DE FERRAND," suggesting it's a Grand Cru Classé from Saint-Émilion. It also mentions "HERITIERS DU BARON BICH," indicating a connection to the lineage or estate of Baron Bich. The label design includes an image of what seems to be a chateau or estate, aligning with the naming of the wine, but no animals are present. I am very sure there are no animals visible in this image.
