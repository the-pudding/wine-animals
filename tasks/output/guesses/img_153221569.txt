There are no animals visible on the wine label in the image you provided. The label primarily features textual information about the wine, including the name of the chateau, the family name associated with it, and its region of origin. There are also some decorative elements, but these do not include any animal imagery. I'm certain of this assessment based on the visible content in the image.
