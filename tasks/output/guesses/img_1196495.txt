Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals on the wine label. It features text and a crown icon at the top, which is typically used to denote a regal or premium quality, but there are no visible animal representations. I am confident in this observation, as the label appears quite clear and straightforward without any intricate designs that might hide small details.
