In the image provided, there is no clear depiction of any animals on the wine label. The label features an illustration that looks to be of a chateau surrounded by a landscape that likely includes vegetation such as trees and possibly vineyards, which is common for wine labels. The focus is on the architecture and possibly the estate where the wine is produced. There are no animals visible in this artwork; the illustration is quite detailed and I'm confident in this observation.
