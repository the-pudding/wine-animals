There do not appear to be any animals depicted on this wine label. The imagery includes what looks like a landscape scene with trees and perhaps a representation of land or flowers, but no animals are distinctly visible. Without a clearer, more detailed image, I can say with reasonable certainty that there are no animals on this label.
