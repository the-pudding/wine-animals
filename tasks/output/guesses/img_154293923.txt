The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "ALFASI CABERNET SAUVIGNON" indicating it's a type of red wine, specifically Cabernet Sauvignon, from "VALLE CENTRAL" region, likely Chile. The top part of the label features a graphic design of a tree. There are no animals depicted on this label, just the graphic of the tree and text. I am confident in this observation because the contents and graphics are clearly defined on the label with sufficient resolution to make out the details.
