No, the label does not display any animals. I see the name "Silk Bush" along with the tagline "The Mountain Vineyards" and the word "ALTITUDE" which suggests the wine may come from high-altitude vineyards. The location is specified as "Breedekloof â€¢ South Africa." There are also decorative lines that may be suggestive of hills or a stylized representation of a landscape, but they do not resemble any animals.
