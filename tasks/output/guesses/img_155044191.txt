The image you've provided shows a wine bottle with a label that depicts a château and its surrounding estate. There aren't any animals visible on the label—it mainly features the landscape and the architecture. I am quite sure of this, as the image provides a clear view of the label, and my ability to analyze images allows me to confirm the absence of animals in the depicted scene.
