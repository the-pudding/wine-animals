The image you've provided shows a label for "Hamacher Chardonnay" wine. There are no animals depicted on this label; I can only see grapevine leaves and text that provides information about the wine, such as the type of wine, the specific blend ("Cuv√©e Forets Diverses"), and the region it comes from (Willamette Valley). The label design does not include any animal imagery, and I am certain of this observation.
