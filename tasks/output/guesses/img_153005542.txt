No, there are no animals visible on the wine label. The label displays the name "Kilikanoon" at the top, followed by an image of a landscape which seems to depict a vineyard. Below this image, the name of the wine "Covenant Shiraz" is shown, along with the region "Clare Valley". There are no illustrations or depictions of animals on this particular label. I am certain of this based on the visible content in the provided image.
