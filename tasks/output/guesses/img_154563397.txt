Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label features text, a large number '2' stylized as part of the word "Ottantuno," and possibly the logo of the winery at the bottom. There are no clear animal figures or illustrations present. I am fairly confident in this observation, as the elements visible on the label are typographic and symbolic rather than representative of animals.
