The image you've provided shows a wine bottle label, and I do not see any animals depicted on the label. The label consists of text with various words and phrases, presumably relating to the wine or the branding of the wine itself. I am confident in stating that there are no animals visible because the picture provided is clear and the label shows only text elements.
