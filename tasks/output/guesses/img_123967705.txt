Yes, there seems to be an animal depicted on the wine label. Above the name "Chateau Lyonnat", there is an image that resembles a lion. Given the context and the usual graphical representations on wine labels, I am fairly sure that it is intended to be a stylized lion, which is often used as a symbol of strength and nobility on heraldic symbols and crests, particularly in European contexts such as Bordeaux wine region insignias.
