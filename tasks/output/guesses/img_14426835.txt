No, I do not see any animals on this wine label. The label features text, including the name of the wine, "Château Potensac," the region "Médoc," and the name "Delon." There's also a small emblem or logo at the top, but it does not depict any animal. I am confident in stating that there are no animals visible on this wine label.
