The image depicts a bottle of Chardonnay wine by Caldora, labeled as a product of Italy from Terre di Chieti with an indication of geographic typicity (Indicazione Geografica Tipica). Based on this image, there are no animals visible on the wine label. I'm quite sure of this assessment given that the label appears to bear only text and some design elements, but does not feature any images of animals.
