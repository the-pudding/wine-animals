Based on the image provided, there are no animals visible on the wine label. This label gives details about the wine, such as it being an "experiment," the blend of varietals used, the alcohol content, and that it is a 2016 California White Wine. There are no illustrations or depictions of animals. I am confident in this observation based on the visible content of the image.
