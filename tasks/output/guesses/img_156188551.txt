Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals depicted on the wine label. The label primarily features text and an illustration of a ch√¢teau or estate. It is designed in a classic style typical of French wine labels, particularly those from the Bordeaux region, as indicated by the text. I am confident in stating that there are no animals visible on this label.
