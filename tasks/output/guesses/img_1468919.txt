There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is quite straightforward with text indicating the brand "Veuve du Vernay," the type of wine "French Sparkling Wine," and the style "Brut" as well as "Clasique & Élégant." It features a decorative emblem and design, but no animals are depicted. I am sure of this based on the presented image.
