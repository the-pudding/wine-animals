No, I don't see any animals on the wine label. It seems to be a standard label with text and some decorative elements that are typical for wine branding, such as a coat of arms or crest at the top. There is no depiction of an animal visible on this label. I am quite sure of this as there are no discernible features on the label that resemble an animal.
