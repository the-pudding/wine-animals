The image shows a bottle of wine from the Touraine region, specifically a Brut Blanc by A. Simoneau. The label does feature a stylized image of what looks to be a fruit with a stalk and a leaf, evoking the idea of grapes, which are typical for a wine label. There does not appear to be any animals depicted on this label. I can say with certainty that the label is focused on the branding for the wine and does not include animals in the imagery.
