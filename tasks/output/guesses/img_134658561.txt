The image shows a wine label, and there do not appear to be any animals depicted on it. The label features text and a graphic representation of a structure, which is likely a chateau or building associated with the wine's origin, but no animals are visible in this picture. I am quite certain of this as the image quality is clear and the subjects on the label are easily identifiable.
