I cannot see any animals on the label. The image on the wine label features a depiction of a chateau, which typically represents the estate where the wine is produced. This type of imagery is common on wine labels to convey a sense of heritage and quality. The focus is on the building and surrounding trees rather than including any animal imagery. I am reasonably confident that there are no animals depicted on this label based on this typical visual representation.
