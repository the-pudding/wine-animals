Yes, there appears to be an image of a small bird on the label of the wine bottle. It is situated above the text, at the center of a crest-like design on the Ch√¢teau Latour-Martillac label. I cannot determine if the bird is part of a family crest, brand logo, or symbolic image without additional context, but its placement suggests it is an intentional part of the label's design. My response is based on the visible content of the image and I am certain about the presence of an animal depiction on the label.
