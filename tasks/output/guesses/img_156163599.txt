There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label features text and simple graphic elements, such as what appears to be a stylized representation of mountains above the brand name "SINIGUAL." The text also indicates the type of wine, which is "Cabernet Sauvignon," and mentions "Mountain Cuvée" as well as the region "Campo de Borja D.O.," which stands for Denominación de Origen, a classification for protected winegrowing regions in Spain. I am certain of this because the text and imagery are clear and there is no depiction of an animal.
