No, I do not see any animals on this wine label. It features textual information and a logo with the initials 'G' and 'L' inside an ornate frame, but there are no animal figures visible. I am quite sure there are no animals depicted on this label as it is a clear image focused on the branding and variety of the wine, specifically "Rosso Veronese."
