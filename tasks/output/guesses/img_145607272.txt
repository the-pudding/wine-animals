Based on this image, there don't appear to be any animals on the wine label. The label features the text "IRANCY PALOTTE", which indicates the type and appellation of the wine, as well as "THIERRY RICHOUX VIGNERON", which is likely the name of the winemaker or vineyard owner. The illustration depicts a village or town with buildings and possibly a church, but there are no discernible animals in the artwork. I'm quite sure about this assessment given the clarity of the image provided.
