The image provided seems to be of a bottle with a label on it, likely a wine bottle given the styling and text. There are no animals depicted on the visible part of the label. The text reads "Yllera Dominus" and "Gran Selección Viñedos Viejos", suggesting it is a selection from old vineyards under the Yllera brand, which may indicate a premium wine product. However, without additional information or imagery, I cannot provide more specific details about what's in the bottle or any symbols that might not be visible in this picture.
