Yes, the wine label features an illustration of what appears to be two horses pulling a chariot. The depiction seems to be in a classical or historical style, and is common in artistic representations seen on labels as a way to convey a sense of tradition and heritage. I'm quite certain that these are the animals illustrated on this label.
