On the wine label, there is no distinct image of an animal. There is a decorative element with leaf-like features and what could be interpreted as a stylized insect or a flower at the top of the arch-like design. However, it doesn't clearly resemble any specific animal. Given the context of a wine label and the decorative nature of the graphic, I cannot say with certainty that there is an intentional depiction of an animal.
