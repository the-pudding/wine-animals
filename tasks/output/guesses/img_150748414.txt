There is an image that appears to represent a hand with a flower, which is a common symbol used by Susana Balbo Wines for their 'Crios' brand. It is not an actual animal; rather it is a stylized representation, which forms part of the brand identity of this particular wine label. I am confident that the image on the wine label does not depict an actual animal.
