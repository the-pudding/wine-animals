There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is for Beaulieu Vineyard (BV) from Napa Valley and it indicates that it's a Cabernet Sauvignon. There is text and some decorative elements, but no animal images or icons on the label. I am certain of this observation based on the image provided.
