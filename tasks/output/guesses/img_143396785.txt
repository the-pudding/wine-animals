The label features a graphic design that consists of what appears to be a stylized decoration or insignia with a central emblem surrounded by what might be interpreted as rays or a starburst pattern. There is no clear representation of an animal on this particular wine label. The design elements are geometric and symbolic rather than illustrative of any fauna. I am quite sure that there are no animals depicted on this label based on the provided image.
