No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The image on the label seems to depict a landscape with vineyards, which is typical for a wine bottle label, possibly representing the wine estate. There is text that identifies the brand and type of wine, but no illustrations or representations of animals. I am certain that there are no animals present in this image.
