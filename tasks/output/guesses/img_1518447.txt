No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is for "BIN 27" reserve port from "Fonseca Porto," and it emphasizes the wine's characteristics, such as being rich, vibrant, intense, and fruity. The design of the label is quite simple, and it doesn't feature any animal imagery. I am confident in this observation.
