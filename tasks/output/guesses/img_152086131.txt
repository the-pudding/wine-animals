The label features a stylized image that could be interpreted as reminiscent of a bird, given its wing-like appearance. However, it's an abstract design, and whether it represents an actual bird or is simply ornamental could be subjective. I'm unable to determine the intention behind the design without context provided by the designer, but it certainly has elements that are evocative of a bird's wings.
