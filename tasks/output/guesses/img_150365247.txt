In the image, it's a label on a bottle of "Leon Beyer" Pinot Gris, which is a type of white wine from the Alsace region in France. The label features illustrations that seem to be of architectural structures such as buildings that resemble a traditional European style, possibly indicating the heritage of the wine.

I do not see any animals on the label depicted in the image. There are only buildings and what seems to be text related to the wine. I'm quite sure there are no animals shown on this particular label based on the visible details.
