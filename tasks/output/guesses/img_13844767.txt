I don't detect any animals on the wine label. The design is quite simple and mostly text-based, featuring the name of the vineyard, the region, and the type of wine. There are some abstract decorative elements, but they do not represent any animals. I am fairly confident in this observation, as the details in the image are clear and there are no ambiguous patterns that could be mistaken for an animal representation.
