In the image you've provided, there is no clear depiction of any animals on the wine label. The label is focused on featuring the name of the wine, "Ch√¢teau Haut-Goujon," along with some other text and an illustration of what appears to be a chateau or estate. I am fairly certain in this assessment; there are no overt animal images visible on this label.
