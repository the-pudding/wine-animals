The image shows a wine bottle label with no animals featured on it. The label includes an illustration of a leaf, along with text providing information about the wine, such as the winery name "BRUNO ROCCA," the type of wine "Barbera d'Asti," and further details like alcohol content, volume and origin. I am certain there are no animals depicted on this label.
