Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. In the central crest of the label, there is a figure that resembles a lion. It's a stylized representation typical of heraldic emblems. I'm quite sure about its presence because its features, such as the mane and the positioning of the body, are characteristic of how lions are often stylized in such artwork.
