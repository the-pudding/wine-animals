Yes, there seems to be an animal depicted on the wine label. Specifically, there is a crest with a lion on it, which is a common heraldic symbol. The lion appears to be in a rampant position, which is a classic stance in heraldry where the animal stands on one hind leg with the other three legs raised, often used to symbolize bravery and valor. I am certain of this observation based on the visible characteristics of the crest on the label.
