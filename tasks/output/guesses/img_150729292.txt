The image appears to be that of a wine bottle with a label featuring an abstract design. No animals are clearly depicted on the label. The design consists of geometric patterns and shapes, specifically triangles that could be interpreted as stylized mountains, where some are filled with red color. The text "sentada sobre la bestia" is displayed, which translates from Spanish as "sitting on top of the beast," which suggests a metaphorical rather than a literal representation. Due to the abstract nature of the artwork, I am quite sure that there are no distinct animals represented on this label.
