From the provided image of the wine label, there do not appear to be any animals depicted. The label is relatively simple and clean in design, featuring text that includes the brand name, the type of wine, and some additional details about its origin and classification. The letter "B" with a circle around it seems to be a logo or symbol related to the brand, but it does not resemble an animal. I am quite sure that no animals are visible on this label.
