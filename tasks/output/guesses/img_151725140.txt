There are no images of animals visible on this wine label. The label contains text, a graphical representation of a building that appears to be a chateau in the center, and decorative elements. The label is clean and simple, typical of many wine labels, where the focus is on the name of the wine, the winery, and the region of production, which in this case indicates Bordeaux.
