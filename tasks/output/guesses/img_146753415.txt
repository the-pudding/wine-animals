There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label features text, including the name "Mt. Monster" and "Chardonnay," as well as additional information indicating it is from the Limestone Coast in Australia and is family owned and estate-grown. The graphic appears to depict a mountain range or a stylized depiction of a peak, which aligns with the name of the wine, but there are no animals or creatures in the image. I am confident in this observation based on the visual information provided by the label.
