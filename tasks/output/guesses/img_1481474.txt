I do not detect any animals on this wine label. The label prominently features text and a depiction of a building, likely a villa, which is consistent with the brand name "Villa Sandi." The text on the label indicates that the product is "Prosecco," a type of sparkling wine, with a designation of "D.O.C.," meaning "Denominazione di Origine Controllata" which is a quality assurance label for Italian food products and wines. The absence of any animal imagery on the label can be stated with high certainty based on the image provided.
