The image displays a wine label, but there are no animals visible on this label. It features text that identifies the wine producer (Schwarz Wine Co.), the name of the wine (The Schiller), the type of wine (Shiraz), that it's from a single vineyard, and the region it comes from (Barossa Valley). There are also numbers at the bottom of the label (1434/1435), which may indicate a bottle number or a limited production run. There is no depiction or illustration of an animal or any other graphic except for the text.
