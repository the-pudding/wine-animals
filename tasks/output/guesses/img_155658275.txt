I don't see any animals on the wine label. The label is designed to present text and branding elements, such as the name "Carlos Serres," the designation "Gran Reserva," and the region "Rioja," which is a famous wine-producing area in Spain. There are also some decorative lines and what appears to be a signature, but no animals are depicted on this label. I'm quite sure of this observation based on the image provided.
