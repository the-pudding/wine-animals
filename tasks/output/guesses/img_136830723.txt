Yes, there appears to be the silhouette of a bull on the label, which is evident within the golden circle. This symbol is often associated with strength and is commonly seen in Spanish culture, especially in the context of "Toro," which translates to bull in Spanish. I'm fairly certain of this observation given that the shape is quite distinctive and matches the typical outline of a bull's head and horns.
