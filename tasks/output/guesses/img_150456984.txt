No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is text-focused with the name "EASTON" prominently displayed at the top, followed by "Fiddletown" and "old vine ZINFANDEL, Rinaldi Vineyard" indicating the brand, the wine's appellation, the type of wine, and the vineyard name. The background features a subtle image which appears to be a tree, but no animals are present. I am confident in this observation.
