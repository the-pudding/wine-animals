Yes, on the wine label, there is an illustration that includes animals. Specifically, there are two lions supporting a shield. This type of emblem is often used in heraldry, which is a symbolic design that identifies a family, person, or organization. The presence of the lions in this emblematic design is quite clear, and I am certain of the depiction based on visual evidence.
