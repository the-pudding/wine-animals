There do not appear to be any animals on the wine label. The label primarily features text and some graphic elements such as styled grapevines or grapes. There are no clear depictions of animals. I am quite certain about this observation, given that the focus of the label design is to convey information about the wine, including its type (Brunello di Montalcino), the vineyard (Le Chiuse), along with the alcohol content and bottle volume.
