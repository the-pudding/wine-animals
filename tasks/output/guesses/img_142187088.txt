The image shows a wine label that reads "Monte Hiniesta" with the word "TORO" in large letters at the bottom, along with "Denominaci√≥n de Origen," which indicates the wine's regional origin. There are no apparent animals depicted on the label. The design appears to be more abstract with a background pattern that does not resemble animals. Therefore, I am quite certain there are no animals depicted on this label.
