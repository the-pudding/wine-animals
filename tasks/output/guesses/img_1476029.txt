In the image provided, I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label features a drawing of a chateau and text providing information about the wine, such as the name "CHATEAU LAGRANGE," the appellation "SAINT-JULIEN," and the fact that the wine is a "GRAND CRU CLASSE EN 1855." There are no visible animal depictions on this label. I am quite sure of this based on the visual information available in the image.
