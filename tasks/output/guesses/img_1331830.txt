The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Famille Tardieu Côte Rôtie Tardieu - Laurent". On the label, there is an intricate design that includes the face of a man surrounded by what seems to be grapevines or foliage. I do not see any animals on this wine label. My response is based on the visible elements in the image provided.
