Based on the image you've provided, it appears to be a label for Casa Valduga Terroir Raízes, a type of Cabernet Franc wine. There are no animals depicted on this label. The design is quite clean and straightforward, mostly featuring text and some graphic elements that suggest vine or root-like imagery consistent with the theme of "Raízes," which means "roots" in Portuguese. I can say with certainty that there are no animals on this wine label.
