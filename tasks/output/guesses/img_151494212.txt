The image depicts a wine label that reads "CAVALLOTTO" at the top and "Barolo" in cursive script in the center. Above the word "Barolo," there is a crest that features a horse and a dog on either side of a shield; these two animals represent the term "Cavallotto," which is Italian for a small horse or figuratively a knight. The label also mentions "BRICCO BOSCHIS," which is likely the name of the vineyard or the specific location where the grapes were grown. Below, it includes the location "CASTIGLIONE FALLETTO - ITALIA," indicating that the wine is Italian, specifically from the Castiglione Falletto area.

Regarding the presence of animals on the label, yes, there is a depiction of a horse and a dog on the crest in the center of the label. I can confidently say this because these images are intentionally designed as part of the label's branding.
