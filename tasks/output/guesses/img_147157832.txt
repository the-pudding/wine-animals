Based on the image provided, there are no animals visible on the wine label. The label reads "VIGNE D'ALTO" and includes some additional text indicating it is a wine of "Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita", which is a quality assurance label for Italian wines. The design is simple with text and decorative elements; there are no illustrations or images of animals present. I am confident in this assessment based on the visible details of the image.
