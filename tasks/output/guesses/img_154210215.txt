No, there are no animals on this wine label. The label is designed with text and decorative elements to convey information about the wine, including the wine type "Barolo," the name "Torriglione," and details about the bottler "GAGLIASSO MARIO" and its origin "La Morra - Italia." The design is quite simple and does not feature any animal imagery.
