Yes, the label features an illustration of a mythical creature that resembles a heraldic griffin. A griffin is traditionally depicted with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. It's a fictional creature, not an actual animal, but it is composed of parts from real animals. The depiction is clear enough that I am certain it is intended to represent a griffin-like figure.
