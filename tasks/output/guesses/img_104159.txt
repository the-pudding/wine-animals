There appears to be an image of a lion on the crest in the center of the wine label. The lion is a common heraldic symbol and is often used on coats of arms and family crests, which is likely the case here. It's depicted within the shield on the labelâ€™s crest, indicating its symbolic importance to the brand or family associated with this wine. I am quite certain about the presence of an animal emblem on this label.
