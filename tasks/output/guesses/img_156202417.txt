The image on the label appears to be an angel or a figure with wings, which is a mythical representation rather than a real animal. The figure has human-like characteristics with wings attached to its back, which is often associated with angels in various mythologies and religious texts. No real animals are depicted on this label. I am confident in this analysis based on the visual elements presented in the image.
