Based on the image provided, there are no visible animals on the wine label. The label displays the name of the wine, "FURVUS," along with what appears to be the name of the vineyard or producer "Vinyes Dom√®nech." The label has a clean and simple design with no animal imagery. I'm confident in this observation as the image is clear and there are no illustrations or graphics that resemble an animal on this particular section of the wine bottle.
