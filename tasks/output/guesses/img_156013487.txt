On the wine label provided, there are no clear, definitive images of animals present. The label features an artistic representation of a vineyard scene with a grapevine, which includes a house and some trees in the background. The design is stylized and focuses more on the vine and elements related to wine production rather than depicting any animals. I'm quite sure of this observation, as there are no explicit animal shapes or figures visible in the image on the label.
