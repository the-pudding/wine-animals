The wine label features an intricate illustration that appears to be of a rural landscape, typical of a vineyard scene. In this depiction, I do not clearly identify any specific animals, as the image mainly shows the terrain and structures. The resolution and size of the image may limit the visibility of fine details, so if there are animals, they aren't prominently displayed or easily distinguishable from this perspective.
