Based on the image you've provided, there are no animals on the wine label. The label is quite simplistic and features text only, with the brand name "Prunotto" at the top and "Barolo" underneath, signifying the type of wine. Below that is the statement "Denominazione Di Origine Controllata e Garantita," which is a quality assurance label for Italian wines. I'm confident that there are no visible animals or depictions of animals on this label.
