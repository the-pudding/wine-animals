Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label features numbers, text, and a crest with a design that includes a shield and what appears to be a small tree or plant motif. There are no clear animal depictions visible on the label from this view. I am confident in this observation, provided the visible section of the label does not contain any animal imagery.
