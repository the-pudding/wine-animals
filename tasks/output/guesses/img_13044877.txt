There do not appear to be any animals on this wine label. The label primarily consists of text with the name of the champagne, the producer, and other information such as "Cuvée Brut" and "Vinifié en fût de chêne," which is French for "aged in oak barrels." The design elements on the label are graphical and typographical without any depiction of animals. I am quite sure of this assessment, as there are no visible images or illustrations that resemble any animals on the label.
