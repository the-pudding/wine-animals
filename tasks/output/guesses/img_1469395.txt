The wine label in the image features text and branding but does not include any visible animals. It is a label for "Champagne Monopole Heidsieck & Co Blue Top Brut," which indicates it is a type of Champagne. The label shows a coat of arms graphic design at the top, which includes some intricate patterns, but there are no discernible animals depicted on this part of the label or elsewhere on the label. I'm confident in this assessment given the clear view of the label provided in the image.
