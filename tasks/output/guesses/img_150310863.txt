I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The image provided does not depict any animals. It is a label from a Cousi√±o-Macul Antiguas Reservas Cabernet Sauvignon wine bottle, which is a Chilean red wine from the Valle del Maipo region. The label showcases text and a sketch which appears to be of a building or winery facade but no animals are visible on this label. I am certain there are no animals depicted on the wine label shown in the image provided.
