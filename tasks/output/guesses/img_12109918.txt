Yes, there appear to be stylized images of animals on this wine label. On both sides of the label, there are illustrations that resemble griffins, which are mythical creatures with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. I am confident in this observation, as the characteristics of the illustrations match that of traditional depictions of griffins with their lion-like body and eagle-like head and wings.
