Yes, the image on the wine label depicts animals. There is a figure that appears to be a bear situated next to a tree and a smaller animal, possibly a cub or another small creature, closer to the figure. I can't specify the exact type of each animal with absolute certainty as artistic renditions can sometimes be stylized, but it does seem to represent a bear-like animal with what could be its offspring.
