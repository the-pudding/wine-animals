There are no animals depicted on the wine label in the image you provided. The label appears quite simple and straightforward, primarily featuring text that identifies the type of wine, the denomination (Amarone della Valpolicella), the winery name (ZENI 1870), and mentions "barriques," which refers to the wine barrels used for aging. The graphic at the top of the label seems to be a crest or logo rather than an illustration of an animal.
