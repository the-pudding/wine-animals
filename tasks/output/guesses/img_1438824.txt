There appears to be no depiction of actual animals on the wine label. The two figures present are stylized representations of cherubs, which are mythological or religious beings often depicted with wings. They are not real animals but allegorical or artistic elements commonly associated with elements of Baroque or Renaissance art, used here likely to convey a sense of tradition, heritage, or quality. I am certain of this observation based on the visual content provided by the image.
