Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It appears that there's a lion on both sides of the central shield-like figure. This type of imagery is not unusual for wine labels, especially those from regions with a long history like Bordeaux in France. The lions are part of a heraldic tradition and are often used to convey a sense of nobility, strength, and heritage. I am certain about their presence on the label as I can visually analyze the image.
