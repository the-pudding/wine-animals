Yes, there appears to be an animal on the wine label. In the upper left corner, there's an image that looks like a winged lion. This depiction is quite stylized and could be interpreted as a mythical or symbolic representation, which is not uncommon in heraldry or decorative motifs related to history and tradition. I cannot provide an absolute certainty without more context, but based on visual analysis, I'm quite confident that it's an intended representation of an animal on the label.
