The label features an abstract pattern that could resemble grapevine leaves. I do not see any clear depiction of animals on this wine label. Given that the image is not of high resolution and subject to interpretation, I cannot assert with certainty whether there is any animal motif hidden within the abstract design or not. However, from what is visible, no animals are clearly represented.
