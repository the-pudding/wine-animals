There do not appear to be any animals visible on the label. The label features an illustration of a chateau and vineyards, with text indicating the name of the wine estate ("Chateau La Couspaude"), the classification ("Grand Cru Class√©"), and the wine region ("Saint-Emilion"). The label is quite detailed in its depiction of the building and the vineyards, but no animals are included in the visible design. I am fairly confident in this assessment based on the image provided.
