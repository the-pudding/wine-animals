The label in the image displays a wine called "Dow's Aged 10 Years Old Tawny Port". On the label, there are no distinct images of animals present. The only illustration appears to be that of two barrels, which are typically used for aging wine or spirits. There's a high degree of certainty in this assessment based on the visible content of the label.
