There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is designed for Santa Carolina Reserva, a Cabernet Sauvignon from the Valle de Colchagua in Chile. It primarily features text and a starburst-like emblem at the top but no depictions of animals. I am certain of this based on the content displayed in the image.
