There are no animals visible on the wine label. The label features an illustration of a person's head, presumably a stylized representation of a figure from the Renaissance period, which could be inferred from the name "DaVinci" as a reference to the famous artist Leonardo da Vinci. The text on the label indicates that it is for "Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie", which suggests it is a type of white wine from the Venezie region in Italy.
