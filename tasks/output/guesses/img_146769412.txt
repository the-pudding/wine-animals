Based on this image, there are no animals visible on the wine label. The label features the name "BAER Winery" and what appears to be a stylized representation of a star or burst of light around a central shape, but this shape does not seem to depict an animal. I am confident that there is no animal imagery on this particular label as presented in the image.
