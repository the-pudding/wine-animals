There are no animals depicted on the wine label. The label is for "Mastrojanni Brunello di Montalcino," and it includes text about the wine, including its designation of origin (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita), alcohol content (14.5% vol.), bottle size (750ml), bottler information, and the company address. The red wax seal at the top does feature an embossed symbol, but it is not clear enough in the image to make out specific details; however, it does not appear to be an animal. I am quite certain in this observation based on the visible elements in the image provided.
