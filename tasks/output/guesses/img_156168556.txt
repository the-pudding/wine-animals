There are no clearly visible animals on the wine label shown in this image. The label is mainly text-based with an illustration of what appears to be a chateau or estate. There are details like trees around the building, but no animals can be discerned within the provided image. Therefore, I am quite sure that there are no animals depicted on this label.
