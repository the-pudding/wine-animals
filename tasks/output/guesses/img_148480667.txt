The wine label features a stylized illustration that includes what appears to be a red fish in the lower left area. This fish-like figure is amongst other abstract and colorful elements that include human-like hands and faces. I am confident in identifying the figure as an intended representation of a fish, due to its shape and the common depiction of fish with side fins and a tail fin, which are visible on this illustration.
