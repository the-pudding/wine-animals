Yes, the image on the wine label appears to feature a horse mid-gallop. This is fairly common imagery on wine labels, where animals can be used to represent the brand, the estate's heritage, or certain characteristics of the wine. I am confident in this observation, as the depicted animal has the distinct shape and features of a horse.
