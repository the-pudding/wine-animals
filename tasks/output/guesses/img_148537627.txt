In the image, there is a crest in the upper part of the wine label that appears to include a depiction of an animal, potentially a lion. However, due to the small size of the crest in the image and the intricate detailing, I cannot state with absolute certainty the exact type of animal depicted without a clearer, closer view. The crest is a common element in heraldry and often includes various symbols, including animals, to represent the lineage, place of origin, or characteristics of the entity it symbolizesâ€”in this case, likely the winery or the family that owns it.
