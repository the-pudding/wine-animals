Based on the image provided, it appears to be a close-up of a wine bottle with a label that reads "QUINTA de RORIZ." There do not appear to be any animals depicted on the portion of the label that is visible. However, I can only comment on the visible part of the label, and without a view of the entire label, I cannot be completely certain if there are any animals depicted elsewhere on it.
