There are no clear images of animals on this wine label. The label primarily features what appears to be a sketch of a chateau with some trees around it. There is text that indicates the name of the wine and other details related to it, such as "Grand Vin de Bordeaux," suggesting that it is a Bordeaux wine, and "Cru Bourgeois," which is a classification of Bordeaux wine. I am quite confident in stating that there are no animals visible on this wine label.
