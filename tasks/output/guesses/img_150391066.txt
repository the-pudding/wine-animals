There are no animals depicted on this wine label. The label primarily features text, which includes the name "Negus", the type of wine "Montepulciano d'Abruzzo", and an indication of its classification as "Denominazione di Origine Controllata". There is also a date "1997" which may refer to the year of establishment or vintage, and an emblem at the top that does not depict animals. I am certain that there are no animals visible on this label.
