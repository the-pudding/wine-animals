There are no animals visible on the wine label you've presented. The label contains text information about the wine, including the brand name "HAPPS," the region "Margaret River East of Alice," the vintage year "2017," and its origin "Western Australia." The design also features a pattern that does not represent any animals. I am certain of this as the image provides a clear view of the label, and no animal imagery can be discerned.
