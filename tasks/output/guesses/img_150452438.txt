The wine label features a coat of arms with a stylized artistic design. It includes creatures that resemble griffins â€“ mythical beasts that have the body, tail, and back legs of a lion, with the head and wings of an eagle. There are two of them, symmetrically placed on either side of a shield. My analysis is based on common heraldic symbols and the typical artistic representation of such creatures. I am quite certain of my assessment based on the traditional iconography commonly used in coats of arms and heraldry.
