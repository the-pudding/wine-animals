I don't see any animals on this wine label. The label is for "King Estate Pinot Gris" from Willamette Valley and mentions that it's family owned and farmed. The graphic elements include a landscape of a vineyard with rows of grapevines and some buildings, possibly representing the winery or estate. Above the vineyard scene, there's a logo with some text, but no discernible animals in the visible design elements. I'm fairly certain of this assessment based on the visible portions of the label.
