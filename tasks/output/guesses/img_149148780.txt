The image presented is a wine bottle with a label that reads "CRÃ‰MANT D'ALSACE Marc Kreydenweiss." The label features a pattern of small icons, which appear to be abstract representations of bottles or perhaps other symbolic imagery related to wine. I do not see any apparent animals in the pattern. The design is geometric and doesn't immediately suggest organic forms like animals. The focus of the label is to signify the brand and type of wine, rather than depicting animals or other unrelated imagery.
