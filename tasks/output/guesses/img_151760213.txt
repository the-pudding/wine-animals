No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label features a graphic of a tree, which seems to represent the "Heritage" of the Taub Family Vineyards as suggested by the name. The roots of the tree are also prominently featured, adding to the theme of heritage and growth. The design is artistic and is not an illustration of an animal. I am certain of this observation based on the image provided.
