Based on the image provided, it appears to be a wine label for a bottle of "Cederberg" from "South Africa," specifically a blend of "Merlot - Shiraz." The illustration on the label depicts a scenic view of a tree, possibly a type of cedar given the name of the wine and the reference to the region, but I do not see any animals present on the label. I'm as sure as I can be without physically examining the label beyond the resolution of the image provided.
