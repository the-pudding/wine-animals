Yes, there appears to be the image of a horse on the wine label. It is stylized and depicted in an artistic manner but it's quite clear that it is intended to be a horse. I am quite sure of this observation based on the common representations of horses in art and iconography, which typically include features like the mane, tail, and overall body shape evident in this image.
