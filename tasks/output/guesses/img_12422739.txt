No, there are no animals on this wine label. The label displays text indicating the brand and type of beverage (Champagne, extra-brut) and the name 'Fleur de craie', which translates from French to 'Flower of chalk' in English, along with vegetal designs that appear to be stylized leaves or vines, which are typical for wine labels to reflect the agricultural nature of the product. I'm certain there are no animals depicted in the visible part of this image.
