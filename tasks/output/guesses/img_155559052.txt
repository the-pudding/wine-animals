Regarding the wine label in the image, I do not see any animals depicted on it. The label features the name "Big Basin Vineyards" prominently at the top, and below it is an artwork of a landscape, possibly vines or a vineyard setting within a natural environment with trees. There is a drawing that depicts what seems to be rows of crops or vineyard rows and foliage, but there are no clear animals in view from this perspective. I am quite sure of this observation based on the visible information in the provided image.
