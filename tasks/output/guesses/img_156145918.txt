The image shows a wine label for "Paolo Conterno Barolo Ginestra." The label is elegantly designed with a clean white background and primarily black text along with some gold accents. At the top, there are two symmetrical decorative elements in gold.

Regarding your question about animals on the label, there does not appear to be any animals depicted in the visible parts of the label. The decorations at the top resemble more of a floral or vine-like design rather than an animal. I am fairly confident in this assessment, but without seeing the entire label, it's possible there could be other elements not within view.
