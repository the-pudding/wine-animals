No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is fairly simple and emphasizes the text, which includes the type of wine, Champagne, and other information about the wine, such as it being a "Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru" and "Brut". There's also an emblem or crest at the bottom of the label, but it does not depict any animals. I am quite certain of this, as the image provided is clear and the label does not feature any illustrations of animals.
