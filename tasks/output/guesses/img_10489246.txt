The image on the wine label appears to be an abstract artistic design rather than a literal representation of animals or other recognizable objects. The patterns and strokes seem to be more about colors and implied motion, which can be interpreted in various ways. Given the abstract nature of the artwork, I cannot confidently assert the presence of animals on the label.
