Yes, there appears to be an animal on top of the gate in the image on the wine label. It looks like a lion statue. Given the context of a wine label, artistic representations of animals such as statues are common and often symbolize something related to the winery or the wine's characteristics. I am confident in my assessment because the shape and posture are consistent with common depictions of lions in statuary.
