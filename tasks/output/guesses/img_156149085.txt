Yes, I can see several animal-like figures on the wine label. There appear to be illustrations of different animals, possibly in a stylized or symbolic form. I see figures that resemble fish, birds, and possibly other creatures. However, due to the artistic and abstract nature of the illustrations, it's not entirely clear what each figure is meant to represent, so there's a degree of interpretation involved.
