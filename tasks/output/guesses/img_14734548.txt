The image you've provided appears to be a label on a bottle of wine. On this label, there are no clear depictions of animals. The focus of this label is textual information about the wine, such as the name of the vineyard, the type of wine, and the region where it's from. It features "Vigneti Le Tordare Recioto della Valpolicella Classico" which suggests that it is a Recioto, a sweet Italian red wine, from the Valpolicella region, and specifically from the 'Le Tordare' vineyards. The label also mentions "Ca' La Bionda," which could be the name of the producer or estate. I cannot determine the existence of animals or any related content beyond what is visible. If there is an animal that is too subtle or integrated into the design, I would not be able to discern or confirm its presence with certainty.
