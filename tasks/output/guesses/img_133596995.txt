The label features an abstract design that could be interpreted as an animal motif by some due to its symmetry and stylized shapes, possibly resembling an insect or a stylized bird with its wings spread. However, since it's an abstract design, it's not definitively an animal. Therefore, I am not certain that it is an animal; it's a matter of interpretation.
