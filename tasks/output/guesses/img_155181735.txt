There do not appear to be any animals on this wine label. The label seems to focus on the brand name "Allegretto" and provides information about the type of wine, which is Cabernet Sauvignon, along with mentioning Willow Creek Vineyard, Paso Robles, and Ayres Family Reserve. The visual elements that are prominent include some elegant script for the brand name and an image of what appears to be a building or a vineyard scene, common thematic imagery for a wine label. I'm quite sure there are no animals depicted here.
