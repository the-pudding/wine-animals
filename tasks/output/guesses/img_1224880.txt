Yes, there appears to be an animal on the label. At the bottom of the label, just below the name "CHÂTEAU LÉOVILLE BARTON," there is an emblem that features what looks like the silhouette of a lion. I can state with certainty that there is an animal depicted on this wine label based on the visible characteristics of the emblem.
