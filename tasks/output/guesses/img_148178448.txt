In the image, I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label reads "Wise Acre," indicates it's from Napa Valley, and specifies the type of wine as Cabernet Sauvignon. The central part of the label seems to show a vintage image of a vineyard, which typically includes grapevines and supporting structures. There are no clear or discernible animal shapes in this picture. I am quite certain of this, given the visual details available.
