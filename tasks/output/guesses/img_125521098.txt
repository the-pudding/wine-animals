I see no animals on this wine label. The label is fairly simplistic and mostly text, featuring the name of the wine, "Le Seuil de Mazeyres," and the region, "Pomerol," which is a prominent wine region in Bordeaux, France. There is a symbol at the bottom, perhaps a logo or emblem connected to the winery, but it does not resemble an animal. Therefore, I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this wine label.
