Yes, there appears to be a depiction of an animal on the wine label. At the top of the crest, there is an image of a lion. The style of the artwork suggests that it is a heraldic lion, which is a common symbol in coats of arms and heraldry, representing courage, nobility, royalty, strength, stateliness, and valor. I am fairly confident in this observation given the traditional design elements present.
