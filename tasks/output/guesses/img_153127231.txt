Yes, there is an image of a peacock on the wine label. It appears stylized and artistic, a common choice for branding to convey a certain elegance or specialty. I am confident in stating this because the depiction includes characteristic features of a peacock, such as its plume of elongated feathers, which are often associated with the bird's distinctive appearance.
