Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It appears to be a bird perched on a branch. The representation of the bird is part of the artistic design of the label and adds an element of nature to the label's overall aesthetic. I'm certain that the image features a bird as it has distinct avian characteristics such as a beak, feathers, and the shape of a bird as commonly recognized.
