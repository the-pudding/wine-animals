The image shows a wine label for "Petit-Figeac," which indicates that it is likely a wine from the Saint-Ã‰milion region of France, made by Famille Manoncourt. On the emblem part of the label, there is an illustration that seems to depict a small animal atop the crest, which resembles a bird, but it is quite stylized and heraldic in nature, so it is not a detailed representation of an animal. This kind of image is common in heraldry and is typically used to represent a family or estate's coat of arms. I am reasonably confident in this description based on the appearance and common practices of labeling wine bottles.
