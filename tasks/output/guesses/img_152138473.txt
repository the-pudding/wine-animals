There is no animal depicted on the wine label in the image. The label features a graphic of a boat with sails, and above it, there is a small graphic that resembles a flame or a simplistic representation of a bird, but it is more suggestive of a stylized flame than an actual animal. I am confident there is no clear depiction of an animal on this label.
