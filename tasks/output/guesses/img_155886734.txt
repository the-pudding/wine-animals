Yes, there appears to be an animal depicted on the wine label. It seems to include a creature resembling a horse within the crest or emblem in the center of the label. I would refrain from certainties without a clearer or more detailed view, but based on the common heraldic motifs often used in wine labels and similar products, it is fairly common to have animals such as lions, eagles, or horses depicted in these designs.
