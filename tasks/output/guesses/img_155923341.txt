Yes, there is an image of a feather on the wine label, which implies the presence of a bird, although the bird itself is not depicted. Feathers are commonly associated with birds, so this suggests a connection to a bird, which is an animal. However, no specific animal is visibly depicted on the label; it is just the feather. I am certain of my observation based on the visible elements in the image.
