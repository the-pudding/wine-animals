Yes, there are animals depicted on this wine label. The coat of arms in the center of the label features what appears to be two lions or similar large cats standing on their hind legs, supporting the shield. I am confident in this observation based on the visual characteristics commonly associated with such animals as depicted in heraldic art and iconography.
