Yes, the image on the wine label appears to include animals; specifically, there are fish within the illustration of a bunch of grapes. The design is quite artistic, incorporating elements of sea life, interwoven with the grapes, perhaps to create a certain theme or aesthetic for the branding of the wine. However, I cannot be certain of any symbolic meaning or the intention behind the design without more context.
