In the image provided, there is a wine label for "Ch√¢teau Daugay Saint-Emilion Grand Cru." The label primarily features an illustration of what appears to be a chateau or a vineyard property surrounded by trees. No animals are clearly distinguishable in the intricate artwork of this label. I am fairly confident in this assessment as the focus of the image seems to be more on the building and possibly the vineyard rather than depicting any wildlife or animals.
