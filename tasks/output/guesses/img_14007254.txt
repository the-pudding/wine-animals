Based on the provided image, the wine label displays a piece of artwork with multiple figures, but there do not appear to be any animals on it. It seems to feature human-like forms engaged in some activity. However, as the image is not entirely clear and the artwork is stylized, I cannot state with absolute certainty that there are no animals depicted. The focus of the label is the brand and type of wine.
