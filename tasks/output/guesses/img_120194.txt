Yes, on the label, there appears to be a depiction of a lion on both the left and right sides of the crest or coat of arms in the center. These lions are commonly used as heraldic symbols and are featured in a stylized, regal posture typical for such emblems. I am quite confident in their identification based on visual examination of the label.
