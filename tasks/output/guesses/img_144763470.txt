Yes, on the wine label, there is an image of what appears to be a coin with stylized animal figures on it. The animals depicted seem to include a bird, possibly a crane or stork, and might also include other animals that are difficult to distinguish due to the stylization. Given that this is an image of a coin, which is often a representation of historical or symbolic figures, my confidence in stating that there are animals depicted is based on the visual elements presented and common symbology. However, it's important to note that since this is a stylized representation, the exact species or types of animals cannot be definitively confirmed.
