The label includes the name "The Lark," which is a type of bird, so the animal reference in the name is a lark. Although the bird itself is not visually depicted in the image you've provided, the name on the label alludes to this animal. I'm confident that there is a reference to an animal, namely the lark, based on the text, even though the animal isn't illustrated on the label.
