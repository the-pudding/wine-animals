I cannot see any specific animals depicted on this wine label. The design consists of an elegant graphical element that resembles a swirl with a string of pearls ascending alongside it, and the text "Prima Perla," which doesn't suggest any animal imagery. I am quite sure there are no animals visible here based on the image provided.
