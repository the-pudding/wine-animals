Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals depicted on the wine label. The label features a name, "EXUBERA SAGRANTINO MONTEFALCO," and appears to be for a type of wine. The design is rather minimalistic with a stylized font and an emblem above the name. I am quite sure there are no animals visible in this particular label design.
