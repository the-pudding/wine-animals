Yes, there appear to be illustrations of animals on the wine label. Specifically on the gold-colored band above and below the main label section, there are depictions that resemble mythological creatures or stylized animals that might be consistent with the aesthetic of traditional or historic decorations. These representations are artistic and ornamental in nature. Without a clearer, closer view, identifying the exact types of creatures may be challenging, but they give the label an elegant and classic look.
