The image is a wine label for "VILLA CERNA Chianti Classico Riserva." Based on the visible details, there are no clear animals depicted on the label itself. The label features an illustration of a building that appears to be a villa or estate with surrounding trees and fields, a common theme for wine labels which often emphasize the winery's location or heritage. I'm quite sure there are no animals as the resolution of the image allows for a detailed inspection of the label's artwork.
