I do not see any animals on the wine label in the image provided. The label appears to feature a mountainous landscape as its background. The name "INFINITO" is prominently displayed at the top, followed by "Winemaker's Selection" and the type of wine, which is "CABERNET SAUVIGNON." There are no visible images or drawings of animals on the label.
