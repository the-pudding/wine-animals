No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label mainly consists of text with the winery's name, the cuvée name 'Cuvée Jean Baptiste', the region 'Pomerol', and other relevant wine information. The emblem at the top does include a crest with decorative elements but does not depict any animals. I am certain there are no animals on this label.
