Yes, the label features two animal figures on either side of a shield. These figures appear to be lions, which are commonly used in heraldry to symbolize strength and courage. I'm confident in this identification based on their stylized appearance with features such as manes and the pose that is typical for lion imagery in heraldic contexts.
