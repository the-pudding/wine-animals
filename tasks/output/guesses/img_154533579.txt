No, there are no animals on this wine label. The label features text that indicates the brand "BREMERTON" and the wine blend "Tamblyn Cabernet Shiraz Malbec Merlot." There is an illustration of a person standing among what appears to be vineyard rows, but there are no animals visible in the image. I am certain of this observation based on the visible content of the label.
