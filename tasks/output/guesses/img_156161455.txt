The image you have provided is indeed of a wine label for "Catena Alta, Historic Rows Malbec" from "Bodega Catena Zapata." Based on this image, I cannot see any animals depicted on the label; the artwork features an illustration of a building that appears to be a winery or estate, surrounded by vineyards. There aren't any discernible animal images in the visible part of the label. I am confident about this assessment because the resolution and clarity of the image are sufficient to make out the details on the label.
