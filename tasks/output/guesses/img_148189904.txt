There appears to be a stylized image of an animal on the label, specifically a bird, positioned above the text. The animal is represented as a simple, elegant silhouette logo, which is quite common to see on brandings such as wine labels. I am sure that the figure is intended to represent a bird given its distinct features, such as the beak and the wings.
