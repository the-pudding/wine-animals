Yes, on the wine label, there is a coat of arms that features an animal. At the top of the shield, there is a lion standing on its hind legs, which is a common heraldic symbol known as a 'rampant lion'. This is a stylized representation often used in emblematic contexts to convey attributes such as bravery, strength, and valor. I am certain of this because the lion is a frequently occurring emblem in heraldry and is distinctly recognizable by its pose and shape.
