The image shows a close-up of a wine bottle with a label that reads "Evolution." It's the "Lucky No. 9 White Blend" by Sokol Blosser. There are no visible animals on the label, and I am confident in stating this as there are no animal representations or illustrations present in this portion of the wine label. The label is quite simple with a focus on the text and branding rather than imagery.
