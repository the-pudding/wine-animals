I don't see any animals on the wine label you've provided. The label shows the brand name "WILSON CREEK" and the flavor "Almond," along with some other details about the wine, but there are no images of animals present on this section of the label. If there are animals depicted elsewhere on the bottle, they are not visible in the image provided.
