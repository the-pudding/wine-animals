From this image of the wine label for Chateau-Chalon, I cannot discern any animals. It primarily features text describing the wine and an illustration of a landscape which appears to include a chateau and some vineyards. The visibility of animals, if any were intended in the illustration, may be limited by the image's resolution and perspective. I am therefore quite sure that there is no prominent depiction of an animal on this particular label.
