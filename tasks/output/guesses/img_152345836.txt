Yes, there appears to be an animal on the wine label, specifically a bird. It seems to be perched, possibly depicted as a crested bird given the details of its head, but the specific species is not clear from the image alone. I cannot measure certainty in an objective way, but based on the visual information presented, I can confirm that the representation of a bird is intended on the label.
