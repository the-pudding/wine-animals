Yes, there are animals depicted on the wine label. At the bottom of the label, there is an illustration of two animals that appear to be engaging with one another. They seem to be mythical creatures, one resembling a lion and the other could be interpreted as a dragon or another mythological beast. These kinds of images are often used on labels to convey a sense of tradition, uniqueness, or to tell a story related to the brand or the origin of the product. I'm certain these are artistic representations of animals as intended by the label's design.
