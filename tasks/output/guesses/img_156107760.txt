Based on the image provided, the wine label features a detailed crest or logo within which a lion appears to be present. The lion is a heraldic symbol often used in coats of arms or crests for its connotations of bravery and nobility. I am quite sure there is an animal depicted on the label based on common heraldic imagery.
