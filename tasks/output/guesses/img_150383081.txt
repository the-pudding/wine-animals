The image shows a wine label, and there does not appear to be any animals prominently featured on it. The label's design is intricate, with a central scene that looks reminiscent of a classical artwork featuring human figures, possibly depicting a scene from mythology or a historical event. The design is ornate and symmetrical, with two figures that seem to be women flanking the central imagery. There are also ornamental elements decorating the rest of the label, but I am confident there are no clear representations of animals visible in this image.
