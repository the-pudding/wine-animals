There appears to be no animals visible on this wine label. The image focuses on the bottle and the label, which prominently features the name of the wine, "Durello," along with additional text that may describe the type of wine or the winery. The design is quite elaborate, but from what is visible, there are no animals depicted on the label. I am fairly confident in my assessment based on the information available in the image.
