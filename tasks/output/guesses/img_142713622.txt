Based on the image provided, there do not appear to be any animals on the wine label. The label displays text, which seems to be the name of the wine or the vineyard, "Sant'Ulderico." There are no visible illustrations or images aside from the textual elements on the label. Thus, I'm very confident that there are no animals depicted on this particular label.
