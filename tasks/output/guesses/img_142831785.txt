The image shows a wine label for "Montefalco Rosso," which includes an illustration of what appears to be a rural landscape with buildings. There are no obvious animals depicted on this part of the label that is visible. The illustration focuses more on architecture and possibly vineyards. I am quite sure that there are no animals in this specific section of the image based on what is visible.
