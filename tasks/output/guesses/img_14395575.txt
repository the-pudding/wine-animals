In the image, you can see a coat of arms design on the wine label, which includes a quadrant with a stylized animal. The image is not clear enough to identify the specific type of animal with certainty, but it appears to be a mythical or heraldic creature. It is part of the graphic design of the label and represents a common element in heraldry.
