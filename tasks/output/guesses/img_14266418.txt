Yes, on the label of the wine bottle there is an image that features an animal. It looks like a heraldic emblem with what appears to be a boar beneath a grapevine. Heraldry often uses animals to symbolize various traits or characteristics, and in this case, the animal is part of the branding for the wine. I am certain that it is an animal depicted on the label.
