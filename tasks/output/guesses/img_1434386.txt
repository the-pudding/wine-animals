This label depicts an illustration of a Chateau, which is a large French country house or castle, surrounded by what appears to be a landscape with trees or shrubbery. There do not seem to be any animals visible on this label. I am reasonably confident in this observation, given that the resolution and details of the image are sufficient to make out the primary elements of the design.
