The image you've provided is of a wine bottle with a label that says "Aperture" along with details like "Cabernet Sauvignon" and "Soil Specific." The label features a picture of grapes. There are no animals visible on this label; it only shows clusters of grapes. I am confident in this assessment, as the image is quite clear and there don't appear to be any hidden elements or motifs that suggest the presence of an animal.
