The image displayed is a wine label, and from what is visible, there do not appear to be any animals on it. The label primarily features text and a graphic of what appears to be a tower or building structure. It's important to mention that while I can describe what is shown, the accuracy of visual descriptions cannot be guaranteed to be 100%. However, in this case, there are no visible animal representations on the label.
