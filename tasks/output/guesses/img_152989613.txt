I don't see any animals depicted on this wine label. The label presents text that includes the brand name "TRIG POINT," the type of wine "Chardonnay," and the locality "Sonoma Coast." Above the text, there is a graphical icon resembling a tripod or surveying instrument, but it does not depict an animal. I am fairly certain of this assessment based on the visible elements in the image.
