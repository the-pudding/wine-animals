There are no animals visible on the wine label. The label features text and what appears to be a landscape scene, most likely an artistic representation of a vineyard or the geographical area where the wine originates. The focus of the label is to convey information about the wine such as the brand "Wildberry Estate", the name "TWO PASSIONS", and the type of wine, which in this case is "Cabernet Sauvignon" from "Margaret River". There is certainty in stating this as the label's content is clearly visible and does not contain any depictions of animals.
