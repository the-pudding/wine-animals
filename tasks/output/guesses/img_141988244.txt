I do not see any animals on this wine label. The label has the brand name "Ao Yun" written in stylized script and some Chinese characters above it. Additionally, there is a graphic element with a decorative design, but it does not resemble an animal. I am quite sure of this since I see no representation of an animal in the image provided.
