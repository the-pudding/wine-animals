On this wine label for Mionetto Prosecco DOC Treviso, there is a small emblem towards the upper part of the label that features what appears to be an animal. The image is quite small, but typically such emblems might include lions, eagles, or other animals that are common in heraldry. Without a clearer view, I cannot be certain of the specific animal, but it seems to be a stylized creature which is likely representative of a family or brand crest.
