In the image, I don't see any depiction that resembles an actual animal. The label features a crest above the name "RAMEY" that contains what appear to be grapevine motifs, which are typical for wine labels, but no animals are depicted within this crest or anywhere else on the label visible in the image. I am quite certain of this observation.
