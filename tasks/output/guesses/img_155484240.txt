There is no clear representation of animals on this wine label. What can be observed are vine-like illustrations with an abstract and somewhat ghostly appearance, reflecting an artistic representation related to the brand "Phantom." There are no distinct animal figures, and the interpretation of the imagery would be subjective. I am quite sure of this assessment based on the visual information presented.
