I do not see any animals depicted on this wine label. The image on the label appears to be an abstract or stylized artwork rather than a representation of any specific creature. It mainly features patterns and shapes without any clearly discernible animal forms. I am reasonably sure of this observation based on the visible content of the image provided.
