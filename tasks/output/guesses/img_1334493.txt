In the image you provided, I do not see any animals depicted. It is a wine label for Marsala wine and displays text that describes the product, but no animal imagery is visible on the portion of the label that is shown. I am very sure of this because the image appears clear and there are no ambiguous shapes that could be interpreted as animals; it features only text and some decorative graphical elements.
