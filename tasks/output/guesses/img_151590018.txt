Yes, the wine label features an image of a bird sitting on a branch. It looks like an illustration rather than a photograph. The label specifically indicates the species of this bird as "GRUCCIONE (Merops apiaster)," which is known in English as the European Bee-eater. I'm sure of this because the name and depiction of the bird are provided directly on the label.
