The image you've provided is of a wine bottle with a label that appears to be for "Amarone della Valpolicella". On examining the label, there is no clear depiction of any animals. The design includes some floral or decorative motifs, but there are no identifiable animals present. I am confident in my assessment based on the visible parts of the label in this image.
