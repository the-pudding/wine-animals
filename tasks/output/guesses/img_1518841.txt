In the image provided, there are no visible animals present on the wine label. The label features text which includes the name of the wine, the type of wine, and the region it originates from—there are no animal images or icons. The information on the label suggests that the wine is a "Crémant de Bourgogne BAILLY LAPIERRE Pinot Noir Brut," which is a specific style of sparkling wine from the Burgundy region in France. I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this wine label based on visual evidence from the image provided.
