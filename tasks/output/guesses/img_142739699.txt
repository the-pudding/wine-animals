Yes, the wine label includes the image of a fish, specifically a salmon. This is likely a coho salmon, which corresponds to the name "COHO" on the label. I am sure about this because the design of the fish, with spots along the back and what appears to be a streamlined shape, is characteristic of a salmon illustration.
