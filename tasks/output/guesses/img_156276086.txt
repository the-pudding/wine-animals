Yes, the label features a stylized illustration of a bird carrying a grape cluster in its beak. The bird appears to be a cartoonish or whimsical representation rather than a realistic depiction of an actual species. I am certain that this is an intentional design choice for the label, and it adds a playful or artistic element to the presentation of the wine.
