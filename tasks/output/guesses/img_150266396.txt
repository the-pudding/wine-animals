I don't detect any clear animal imagery on the label. The label contains text that reads "Marqués de Cáceres Crianza Rioja Denominación de Origen Calificada," featuring a coat of arms and decorative elements, but there is no overt representation of an animal. I am fairly confident in this assessment based on the visual information provided.
