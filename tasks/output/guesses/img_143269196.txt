The image on the wine label appears to depict a silhouetted scene with human-like figures, not animals. It looks like the figures are engaged in a dynamic activity, which could resemble dancing or some form of celebration. The design is quite stylized and abstract, so the interpretation might vary from person to person, but there's a high level of certainty that the figures portrayed are intended to be human and not animals.
