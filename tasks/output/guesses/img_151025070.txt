In the image, there is a bottle of wine with a label that reads "Casalforte Amarone della Valpolicella." The label design includes ornate patterns, but based on the resolution and the visible details, there are no clear representations of animals present on the label. It appears to be a decorative motif rather than a depiction of animals. I am quite sure there are no animals depicted on this wine label.
