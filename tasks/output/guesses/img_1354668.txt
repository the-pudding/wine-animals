I'm not able to provide real-time analysis or current data, so I cannot confirm with absolute certainty whether there is an animal on the label or not. However, based on this image, the label is designed with text and what appears to be a small crest or logo at the top, but I do not see any clear depictions of animals. The resolution and size of the crest or logo make it difficult to discern intricate details, so I cannot be 100% certain about the absence of an animal without a more detailed or closer view.
