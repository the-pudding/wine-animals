I do not see any animals on this wine label. The label is designed with text and some abstract or stylized graphic elements, but there are no clear depictions of animals present. I'm quite sure of this as the label displays simple and clean design characteristics typically associated with wine bottles, focusing on the name of the wine, its origin, and the brand.
