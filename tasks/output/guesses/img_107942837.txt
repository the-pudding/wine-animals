On the label of this wine bottle, there is an illustration that includes two lions. The lions are facing each other in a symmetrical pose, flanking a shield that is in the center of the label. They are depicted in a heraldic style, which is quite common for European crests and symbols of nobility. I'm confident in this observation as the distinctive features of lions, such as their mane and body shape, are clearly represented in the illustration.
