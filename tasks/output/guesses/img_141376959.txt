I do not detect any animals on this wine label. What I can observe is a design that appears to be an abstract representation of vine branches, typical for a wine label. This art style uses organic lines and shapes that might sometimes be suggestive of forms found in nature, but in this case, there are no clear animal figures present in the image. I'm quite sure there are no animals depicted on this label.
