The image shows a wine label, and there are two forms that could potentially be interpreted as stylized representations of feathers. Feathers are associated with animals, specifically birds, but these shapes are abstract and could be simply a design element without necessarily representing an actual animal. Therefore, I cannot conclusively say there is an animal present; it is more an artistic depiction or design that could be suggestive of an element of an animal (like feathers).
