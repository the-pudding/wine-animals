Based on the image provided, there appear to be no animals depicted on the wine label. The label features an image of a structure surrounded by vegetation, possibly a vineyard or winery located in Napa Valley, and the name of the wine, "ALTA MURA Cabernet Sauvignon." The label does not show any clear representations of animals. I am reasonably sure of this assessment based on the visible details in the image.
