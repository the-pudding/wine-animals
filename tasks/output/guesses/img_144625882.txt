I don't see any animals on the wine label. The label features the name of the wine "Les Terrasses de Saint Christophe," which is classified as "Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru." There is an illustration that seems to depict a chateau with trees, but no animals are visible in this image. I am confident in my observation.
