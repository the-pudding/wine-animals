Yes, there is a stylized image of a bird on the wine label. The drawing is quite simple and abstract, featuring a bird with minimal detail, but it is identifiable as a bird. I am confident in this interpretation based on the general shape and features that are characteristic of a bird: a beak, a rounded body, and what appears to be a wing.
