The image you've provided shows a wine bottle label for "GÃ©rard Bertrand Le Viala." At the top of the label, there is a crest or emblem that features a lion on each side of a shield. These lions are stylized and part of the emblem design, not real animals. My identification is based on the common use of animals in heraldry to symbolize various qualities and attributes, and I am confident in this identification based on visual inspection of the image.
