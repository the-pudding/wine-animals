In the image provided, the wine label for "Casa Piena Cabernet Sauvignon" from Napa Valley does not depict any animals. The label features an illustration of what appears to be a vineyard estate with a house and surrounding landscape. No animals are visible in the imagery on this label. I'm certain of this observation based on the visible elements in the image provided.
