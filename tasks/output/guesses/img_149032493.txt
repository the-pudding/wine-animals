I cannot see any animals on the label. The label primarily features text and a small graphic of a building that appears to be a house or winery. The text includes the brand name "MARTINELLI," the wine variety "Chardonnay," and the region "Russian River Valley." There are no visible animal figures on this particular label based on the image provided.
