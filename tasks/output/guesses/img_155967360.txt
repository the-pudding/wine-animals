No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label principally features text, consisting of the brand name "DORIGO," a location reference "vignaioli in Friuli," and the grape variety "Pignolo." There are no illustrations or depictions of animals present on the label. I am certain of this based on the visible content in the image provided.
