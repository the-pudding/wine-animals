Based on the image provided, there are no visible animals depicted on the wine label. It primarily features text, including the name "Fran√ßois Crochet," the wine region "Coteaux du Giennois," the specific vineyard or place name "Les Perrois," and the vintage "2014." The label has a simple and classic design without any illustrative elements that might suggest animals or other motifs. I am certain of this analysis as there is nothing suggesting the presence of animals within the visible parts of the label.
