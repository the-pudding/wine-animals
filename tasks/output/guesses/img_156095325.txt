No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label includes text such as "Casillero del Diablo," "Reserva," "Ros√©," "Chile," and "Concha y Toro," which is the name of the winery, established in 1883. The design is focused on text and branding without any animal imagery. I am certain there are no animals depicted on this label.
