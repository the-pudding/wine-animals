The image shows a wine label for "Château de Pressac," which indicates it is a Grand Cru Classé wine from the Saint-Émilion region. The label features an illustration of what appears to be a chateau or estate, which is typical for wine labels to reflect the origin or the winery. I do not see any animals depicted on this label. The focus of the illustration is strictly on the architectural representation of the chateau. I am confident in my assessment as the image is clear and any prominent features are discernible.
