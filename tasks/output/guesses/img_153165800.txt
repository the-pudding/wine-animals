Yes, based on the image provided, it appears that there are animals depicted on the wine label. It looks like there might be a horse or horses pulling a plow, which is a traditional scene relating to agriculture and winemaking. However, the image is somewhat small and the details are not entirely clear, so I cannot be completely certain without a closer and more detailed view.
