Yes, the label depicts the shadow of a creature that resembles a cat, created by the apparent interaction of light with a figure wearing a pointed hat, reminiscent of a gnome or a similar fantastical character. However, given the context and the artistic representation, it's clear that the "animal" in question is a designed effect and not a real animal. I am certain that the image of the animal on the label is a creative illustration rather than a photograph of a real animal.
