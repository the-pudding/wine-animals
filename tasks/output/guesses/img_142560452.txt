The label features an artistic representation of a hare (a type of mammal similar to a rabbit) that appears to be leaping or possibly flying, which is not a natural behavior for a hare. This depiction is likely symbolic or stylized for the purpose of branding. I'm certain that the image is intended to represent an animal, specifically a hare, given its distinguishing long ears and body shape.
