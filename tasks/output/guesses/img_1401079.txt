The wine label in the image features a crest or emblem with a symmetrical design that may resemble or suggest the presence of a pair of animals as part of the heraldic elements. These figures look like stylized lions or some similar beasts that are commonly used in heraldry, standing on either side of a central shield. The image is not clear enough to determine with absolute certainty if they are indeed animals, but based on common design practices for heraldic crests, it is likely that these are intended to represent lions or similar animals in a heraldic and decorative fashion.
