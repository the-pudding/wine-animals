The label in the image does not appear to contain any animals. It features a coat of arms with a shield, which includes a design element resembling a tower or structure and possibly a cross, but no animals can be discerned within the visible design. I am as sure as I can be without any further context or a more detailed image that would reveal more of the label's artwork.
