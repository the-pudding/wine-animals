The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Luna Nuda Italia Prosecco." The label features a stylized image of a crescent moon surrounded by stars and what appears to be floral or botanical illustrations. I do not see any animals depicted on the label. From the visual information provided, I am confident in stating that there are no animals visible on this wine label.
