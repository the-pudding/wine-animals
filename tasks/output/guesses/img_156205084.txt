I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label appears to contain text related to the branding and variety of the wine, which is "TOURNON Pyrenees Grenache Landsborough Vineyard" from "M. Chapoutier Victoria", indicating it is a wine from Australia. There is a textural background that suggests a pattern or texture similar to dots or grapes, but there are no discernible animals present in the image with certainty.
