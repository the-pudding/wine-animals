Yes, there are animals depicted on the wine label's illustration. The label features what appears to be a mythical creature resembling a winged lion on the left and a peacock on the right among various decorative elements. These representations often serve as allegorical or symbolic elements and are common in label art to convey a sense of tradition, quality, or origin. As an AI, I cannot be 100% sure of anything that requires interpretation of artwork, but based on common depictions of such animals, I am fairly confident in this description.
