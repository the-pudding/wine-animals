No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label primarily consists of text and some decorative elements. It looks like a typical wine label with the name of the wine, the type, and possibly the brand or vineyard that produced it. I can confirm this with certainty as the label is clearly visible and contains no images of animals.
