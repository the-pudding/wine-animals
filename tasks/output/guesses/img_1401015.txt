Yes, there is an illustration of a lion on this wine label. It seems to be a stylized depiction commonly used for heraldic or symbolic purposes, particularly on European coats of arms and logos. I'm quite sure it's a lion based on the typical features displayed in the image, such as what appears to be a mane and the general body shape that one would associate with a lion.
