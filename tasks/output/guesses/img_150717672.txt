In the image provided, which is a wine label for "CLOS DES LAMBRAYS GRAND CRU," there is a crest at the top of the label that appears to feature an animal, specifically a lion. The depiction of a lion is common in heraldry and is often used to represent strength and nobility. I am confident in my interpretation based on the visual evidence on the label.
