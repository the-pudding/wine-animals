Yes, there appears to be an animal depicted on this wine label. It looks like the silhouette of a horse in the center of the label, and there are small graphics that may represent butterfly shapes surrounding it. I cannot be certain about the smaller shapes without a clearer image, but I am confident that the central figure is that of a horse.
