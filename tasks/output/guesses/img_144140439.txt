The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "Cantine Santa Vittoria" and "Langhe Arneis," indicating the producer and the type of wine, which is from the Langhe region and made from the Arneis grape variety. Above the text, there appears to be an emblem or crest, but from the resolution and angle of the photo, it is not clear enough to definitively say whether there is an animal depicted within that emblem. There are no clear, distinguishable animals visible on the part of the label that is shown. Therefore, I cannot confirm the presence of any animal imagery with certainty.
