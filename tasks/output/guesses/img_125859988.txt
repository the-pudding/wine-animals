There appears to be no clear depiction of animals on the wine label provided. The label features text and ornamental designs, which are typical for a wine label. There is a small emblem or crest in the center, but it is not detailed enough in this image to definitively identify any animals. Therefore, I am quite sure that there are no distinct animals visible on this label.
