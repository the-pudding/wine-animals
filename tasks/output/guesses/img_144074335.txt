In this image of a wine label, I do not see any animals depicted. It features the text "Château Labat," "GRAND VIN," and "Haut-Médoc," along with a symmetrical illustration that seems to represent a vineyard or estate, but there are no animals visible in the design. I am confident in this observation based on the visual information provided in the image.
