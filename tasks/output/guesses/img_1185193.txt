There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label features an illustration of a chateau, which is the Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou, a wine estate in the Saint-Julien appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. The label provides information such as the name of the chateau, the classification of the wine (Grand Cru Classe), and the appellation (Saint-Julien) it comes from. The absence of animals is evident as the focus of the label is on the building and the text providing information about the wine.
