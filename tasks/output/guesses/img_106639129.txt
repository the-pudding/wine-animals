I don't see any animals on this wine label. It features text that describes the wine brand, the wine type, its appellation (Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape) which is a renowned wine region in France, and some additional information related to bottling and production. The label is designed with a focus on typographic elements and doesn't include animal imagery. I'm quite sure about this observation based on the image provided.
