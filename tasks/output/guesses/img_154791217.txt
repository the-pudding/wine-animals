I don't see any animals in the image you provided. The label features a graphic design with a starburst pattern consisting of alternating lines in the style of the American flag's colorsâ€”red, white, and blue. There's text indicating the type of wine, the brand name, and its origin, but no animals are visible in the design. I am confident in my assessment.
