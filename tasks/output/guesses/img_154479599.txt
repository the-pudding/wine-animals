Yes, the label features an animated image of a dog. It appears to be a cartoon representation with a stylized look, characterized by its large eyes and cheerful expression. The dog is wearing a scarf and appears to be speaking, with a speech bubble that includes the word "TRIFULA" which is likely the name of the wine. I am certain this is an illustration of an animal (a dog) on the label.
