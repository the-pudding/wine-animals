The image shows a label from a wine bottle. The label reads "HARRIS ESTATE VINEYARDS Casey's Lakeview Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Calistoga Napa Valley." There is a logo at the top, which is stylized with what appears to be a letter "H" that has some decoration to it. However, there are no clear or discernible animals depicted on this label. I am quite sure of this, as I can analyze the visual information presented and there are no illustrations or symbols that resemble animals.
