Yes, there appears to be an emblem that features a pair of animals on the wine label. The emblem looks like a crest or coat of arms which commonly display animals in symbolic ways. In this case, the animals appear to be lions, as they are often used in heraldic imagery to represent strength and nobility. I am quite sure they are intended to be animals due to their stylized representation, which is typical for such emblems on wine labels and similar items.
