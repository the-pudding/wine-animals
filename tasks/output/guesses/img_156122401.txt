Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine labelâ€”it is a silhouette of what appears to be a griffin, which is a mythical creature commonly represented with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion, and the head and wings of an eagle. It's a symbolic representation and not a real animal. I am certain about this as it matches the typical iconography associated with griffins in art and symbolism.
