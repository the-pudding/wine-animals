The image you've provided is of a wine label, and from this angle and resolution, I do not see any animals depicted on it. The label primarily features an illustration of a building, presumably a chateau, given the text "Ch√¢teau Deyrem Valentin Margaux." The label design is quite elegant, focusing on architectural features and using a refined, script-like font for the text. There could be small design elements that are not distinctly visible in the current resolution, but based on what is clearly seen, there are no animals present.
