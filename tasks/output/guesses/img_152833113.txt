Yes, on the wine label, there are images of two lions facing each other, positioned on either side of a letter 'M' which seems to be the central emblem of the logo. These lions appear to be designed in a heraldic or coat of arms style which is often used to convey a sense of tradition or nobility. I am sure of this observation as the elements are clear and visible on the label.
