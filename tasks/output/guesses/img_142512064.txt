There don't appear to be any animals on this wine label. The label is primarily text, with the brand name "UNDURRAGA" at the bottom, the letters "T.H." at the top (which stand for Terroir Hunter), and some additional text that describes the wine ("Sauvignon Blanc," "Lo Abarca," "Altered granitic plateau," "2.8 hectares," "Limited to 720 cases"). There are also some graphical elements and patterns around the text, but no identifiable animals. I am quite sure of this assessment based on the information visible in the image.
