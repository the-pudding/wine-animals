Based on the image provided, the wine label does not feature any prominent or obvious depictions of animals. It mainly consists of text and a landscape illustration within the upper section of the label. Please note that animal depictions can be highly stylized or abstract, especially in logos or seals, so without close inspection of every element, there is a small chance of overlooking a subtle animal representation. However, from what can be observed in the image, there are no clearly identifiable animals.
