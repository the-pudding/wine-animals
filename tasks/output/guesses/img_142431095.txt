There are no clear or obvious depictions of animals on the wine label provided in the image. The label features text that provides the name of the winery, Zaca Mesa, along with information like "Mesa Reserve - Syrah," the vineyard location in Santa Ynez Valley, and the establishment year of 1973. The graphical element above the text does not clearly represent an animal; it appears more abstract or architectural. Therefore, I am confident that there is no depiction of an animal on this label.
