Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It appears to be a drawing of a dog in mid-leap, positioned above the text. I'm confident it's an animal illustration because it matches the common representation of a dog with distinct features like the shape of the body, the positioning of the legs, tail, and head.
