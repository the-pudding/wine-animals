I don't see any animals on the wine label. The label primarily features text, with the name "Chardenet" prominently displayed, followed by "Durrell Vineyard" and "Sonoma Coast." There's also a small logo or emblem at the bottom right, but it doesn't resemble an animal. I am confident in my observation that there are no animals depicted on this label.
