The image is of a wine bottle and the label is clearly visible, but in this particular view, there are no animals visible on the label. The label features text, including the name of the wine, "Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape," along with other information such as the volume, alcohol content, and the producer's name. I cannot make a definitive statement about the presence of an animal that might be on parts of the label that are not visible in this image, but based on what is shown, there are no animals depicted.
