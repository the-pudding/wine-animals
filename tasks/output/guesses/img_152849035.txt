There is no image of an animal visible on this wine label. The label is for "Little Yering Chardonnay" from Yarra Valley, and it includes text information such as the size of the bottle (750ml), the producer (Yering Station), and the establishment date of Victoria's first vineyard (1838). No animals are depicted. I am confident in this assessment based on the content present in the visible portion of the label.
