Based on this image, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is text-centric with the words "TERRA DI MONTEVERRO Toscana" prominently displayed, and there is a logo or emblem at the top. There are no illustrations or depictions of animals apparent. I'm confident in this observation based on the visible content of the image.
