In the image, the wine label "Tenuta Colombarola GANDINIA" does not prominently feature any animals. The label primarily consists of text with a coat of arms that includes a shield and a crown. It's a decorative element commonly used in logos and labels to convey a sense of tradition and quality. I do not see any animals on this label, so I can confidently say there are no animals depicted in this image.
