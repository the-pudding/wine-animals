The image you've provided shows a bottle of Antaño Rioja wine. There is no clear depiction of an animal on the visible part of the label. The label design primarily contains text, a scene of a building which appears to be a traditional winery or estate, and some additional decorative elements. The logo above the text "Garcia Carrión" appears to be a stylized emblem, but it does not distinctly represent an animal. I am quite sure of this observation based on the visible portion of the label in the image. If there are other parts of the label not visible in this image, I cannot comment on their content.
