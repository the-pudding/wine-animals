The image shows a wine label, and there is an emblem with what appears to be a lion within it. This lion is part of a heraldic symbol and is not an actual animal. Heraldic animals are commonly used in logos, crests, and labels to convey tradition, legacy, or to symbolize certain qualities. I am confident in my interpretation of the image provided, considering the common use of such symbols in branding and labeling.
