From what is visible in the image, there are no animals present on the wine label. The label is titled "TERRA UNICA" and mentions the type of wine as "tempranillo - merlot reserva," its volume content as "13% vol," the year "2017," and that it is a "product of Spain." The background texture looks like it may be an artistic representation but does not contain discernible animal imagery. I am confident in this analysis based on the visible information.
