The wine label shows an emblem with a lion on it, which is placed above the illustration of the chateau. It is a stylized, graphic depiction of a lion, which is commonly used in heraldry and emblematic designs on wine labels to convey a sense of tradition and nobility. I am certain that it is a lion because of its general shape and features that are characteristic of traditional lion imagery in heraldic symbols.
