The image shows the label of a wine bottle from the Muga winery, located in the Rioja region of Spain. The label reads "Reserva" and "Rioja," indicating the quality and origin of the wine. Below the name "Muga," there is a small coat of arms or crest, but the image resolution does not allow me to identify any specific details that could be interpreted as an animal with absolute certainty. If there were any symbols or animals represented in the crest, they are not clearly visible in this picture.
