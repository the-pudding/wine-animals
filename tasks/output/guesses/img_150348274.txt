There are carved representations of creatures that appear to be mythological or allegorical figures flanking the central image, which features a landscape or estate drawing. These figures might be interpreted as part human and part animal. The exact nature of these creatures is styled artistically, and therefore their identification might not be representative of real animals. My ability to analyze images is not perfect, but given the context of a wine label, such depictions are common as decorative elements and often don't represent actual animals.
