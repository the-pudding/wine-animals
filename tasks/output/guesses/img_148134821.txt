The image doesn't clearly depict any animals on the wine label. The design features text and geometric patterns, but no discernible animal shapes. There's a stylized 'X' pattern that appears somewhat lace-like or cellular, but nothing that definitively resembles an animal. I'm quite sure that no animals are visually represented on this label based on the image provided.
