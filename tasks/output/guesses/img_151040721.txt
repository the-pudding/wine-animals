The label features a sketched illustration of a landscape with buildings that appear to be part of a winery estate. There do not seem to be any animals depicted on this particular label. I am quite sure of this assessment, as the image is clear and there are no visible animal figures in the illustrated scene. If there are any subtle or hidden elements that might suggest the presence of an animal, they are not apparent in this view.
