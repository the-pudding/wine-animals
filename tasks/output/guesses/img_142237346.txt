Yes, there appears to be an animal depicted on the wine label. At the top part of the label, you can see the silhouette of a bird in flight. It looks like a small bird, stylized in a somewhat realistic manner. Since this is a graphical representation of a bird on a wine label, I am confident in stating that it is an animal depicted for artistic or branding purposes.
