Based on the image provided, the wine label features an illustration of a building surrounded by trees, likely representing the winery or estate where the wine originates. There are no animals visible on this label. The text on the label denotes that the wine is from "Château Magdelaine," a "Premier Grand Cru Classé" in "Saint-Émilion Grand Cru." My assessment is based on the visible elements of the image, and I'm confident that there are no animals depicted on the label.
