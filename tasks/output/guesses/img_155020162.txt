The image displays a wine bottle with a label that says "Chorey-Les-Beaune 'Clos Margot'". As part of the label design, there is a small, monochrome illustration of what appears to be a vineyard scene. Within this scene, no animals are clearly depicted; the focus is on vines and the environment typically associated with a vineyard. I cannot identify any animals with certainty in this illustration. The label also shows the producer's name "Dubois Bernard & Fils" and indicates it is a product of France. Would you like to know more about the vineyard or the type of wine?
