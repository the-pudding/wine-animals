Yes, the wine label features an emblem with an animal on it. The emblem appears to have a lion within it. The presence of an animal, specifically a lion, as part of the brand or winery's emblem is common in heraldry and logos to denote nobility, strength, or heritage. The clarity of the animal's depiction in the emblem makes me quite sure that it is intended to represent a lion.
