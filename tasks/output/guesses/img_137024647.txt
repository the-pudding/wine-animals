On the wine label provided, there are no animals depicted. The label primarily features text, including the name of the winery "Gundlach Bundschu," the type of wine, which is "Cabernet Sauvignon," and the region "Sonoma Valley, Sonoma County." The label also features the established date of the winery "Est. 1858," along with a logo at the top, but there is no tangible presence of an animal anywhere on the label. I am certain of this observation.
