The image depicts a wine label with an illustration that resembles a cherub or putto, which is a figure often modeled after human infants with wings, resembling what many perceive as an angel. There are no actual animals depicted on this wine label, only the artistic representation of a winged child-like figure. I am certain that there are no real animals on the label based on the image provided.
