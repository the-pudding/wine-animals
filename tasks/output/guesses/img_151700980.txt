Yes, on this wine label, there is an emblem that features an animal on the right side. It appears to be a lion, a common symbol in heraldry, which is often used for the representation of strength and nobility. The emblem is split vertically with the three towers on the left side and the lion on the right side. I am fairly sure of my observation since the lion is a distinctive symbol that is widely recognizable.
