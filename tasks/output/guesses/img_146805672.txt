The wine label features an emblem at the top that appears to be a stylized depiction of a bird, possibly an eagle, based on the shape of the head and the spread wings. However, given the abstract and stylized nature of the emblem, the exact type of bird is open to interpretation. I'm reasonably sure that it is intended to be a bird, but it's not a real animal; it's a graphical representation or logo.
