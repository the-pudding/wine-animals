On the wine label, there is an emblem that features an animal. It appears to be a lion, which is a common symbol of nobility and strength, often used in heraldry. The lion is stylized and rendered in a classic emblematic form typically seen on crests or coats of arms. It is standing on its hind legs with what seems to be a crown on its head, reinforcing the regal connotation. I am certain that the depiction is meant to represent a lion.
