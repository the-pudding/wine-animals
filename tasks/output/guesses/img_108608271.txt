The image shows a wine label and, based on the visible parts of the label, there do not appear to be any animals depicted on it. The label is for 'Shutter Cabernet Sauvignon 2013' from 'Barrel Selection - Napa Valley'. The design appears to be text-based with a clean and simple aesthetic. Without any animal imagery visible, I can say with high certainty that there are no animals on the displayed portion of the label.
