There are no animals evident on this wine label. The label features textual elements including a large stylized letter "R" and the name "ROMEO" below it, along with the text "MONASTRELL RED WINE" indicating the type of wine contained in the bottle. The design is minimalist without any animal imagery. I am confident in this observation based on the image provided.
