There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label consists of text only, displaying the name "Castell de Sant Pau" along with other information about the wine such as "Cava Brut Nature" and "Methode Traditionnelle." The absence of any animal imagery is clear, so I am certain there are no animals depicted on this label.
