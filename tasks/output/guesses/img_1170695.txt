The image shows a wine label from Villa Mt. Eden, indicating it's a Cabernet Sauvignon from the 1982 vintage, produced and bottled in the Napa Valley. There are no visible animals on this label; it features an illustration of a building that appears to be a house or winery. I am quite sure of this assessment as no animal figures are present in the illustration or on the label's visible parts.
