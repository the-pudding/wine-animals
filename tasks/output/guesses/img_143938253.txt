The image shows a close-up of a wine bottle label that reads "DESTELLO CAVA BRUT RESERVA PRODUCT OF SPAIN." There are no animals visible on this label; it features a graphic design with lines radiating from a center point to give the impression of a sparkle or "destello," which translates to "twinkle" or "sparkle" in Spanish. I am very sure of this as I can closely inspect the image and see no signs of animal imagery.
