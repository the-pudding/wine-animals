In the image provided, there are no animals visible on the wine label. The label features some text and what appears to be a silhouette of a person standing in a curved structure or vessel that might be reminiscent of the hull of a boat or a crescent shape. The design seems abstract and focuses on the figure and the flowing lines around it. I am confident in my observation that there are no animals depicted on this label.
