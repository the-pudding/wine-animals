The image shown is indeed of a wine label, specifically for a wine called "Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon," from Diamond Creek Vineyards. I do not see any animals on the label; the image appears to depict a landscape with a hill or mountain, presumably to illustrate the "volcanic hill" referenced by the name of the wine. There are no clear depictions of animals present in the visual elements of this label.
