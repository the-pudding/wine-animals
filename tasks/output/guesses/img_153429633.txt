There are no animals visible on the wine label in the image provided. The label is quite simple and features text, along with a cursive "S" which appears to represent the brand or a signature style of the wine, but it does not depict an animal. I am certain of this as there are no animal shapes or illustrations present on the portion of the label shown in the image.
