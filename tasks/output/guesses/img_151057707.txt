Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label is for "Medalla Real Gold Medal Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Santa Rita." It features an illustration of a vineyard estate but no animals are visible in the design. I am confident in this observation given the clarity of the image and the details that are visible.
