Yes, there are animals on this wine label. There are two stylized illustrations of rabbits on the upper part of the label on the left and right side. They are blue in color and seem to be mirrored images of one another with a plant motif in the background. In the center, within a circular frame, there's also an illustration of a bird that appears to be a duck. The images are quite clear and distinct, so I am sure these depictions represent animals.
