No, there are no animals depicted on this wine label. The label contains text that reads "A to Z Wineworks Bubbles" along with the tagline "The Essence of Oregon." There are also some graphical elements that appear to represent bubbles, which might be indicative of a sparkling wine, but no animals are present. I am sure of this observation based on the content of the image.
