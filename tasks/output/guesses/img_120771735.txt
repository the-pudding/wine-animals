There are no animals visible on the wine label in the image. The label displays text, which includes the name "Château Montviel," the wine region "Pomerol," and "Vignobles Père-Vergé," indicating the vineyards or estate where the wine is produced. The style is typical for a wine label, focusing on typography without any illustrative elements like animals.
