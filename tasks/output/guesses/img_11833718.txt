There are no animals visible on the wine label you've provided. The label features the letters "QED" in large font, which is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase "Quod Erat Demonstrandum," typically used at the end of a mathematical proof or philosophical argument to signify that what was to be shown has been proven.
