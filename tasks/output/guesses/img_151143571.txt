I do not see any animals on the wine label. The design features what appears to be floral or plant-like illustrations with no clear depiction of animals. The label is primarily for decorative and branding purposes, showcasing the name "MAS DE CAN BLAI" which suggests it is from a specific winery or vineyard. I am quite sure of the absence of animals in the visible parts of this image. If there are animals elsewhere on the label that are not visible in this image, I cannot confirm their presence or absence.
