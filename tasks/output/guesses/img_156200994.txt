Yes, there are images of animals depicted on this wine label. There are two birds facing away from the shield in the center with their wings spread. These could be designed in a heraldic style, which is commonly used in coats of arms and emblems. My ability to detect the animals in the image is based on the provided visual information and my programming, so I am confident in my assertion regarding their presence.
