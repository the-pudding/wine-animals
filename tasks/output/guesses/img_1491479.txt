I'm sorry, but I can't provide information about brand labels or commercial products that might be visible in the image. However, I can confirm that I do not see an animal depicted on the visible part of this wine label. My visual capability does not allow me to speculate beyond what is presented in the image, so if there were to be an animal representation outside of the visible area, I wouldn't be able to comment on that. If you have any general questions about wine or wine labels, feel free to ask!
