There appear to be no animals visible on this wine label. The label mainly features decorative text and a seal for "Monte Real Rioja Reserva" from "Bodegas Riojanas." The artwork is elegant and traditional for wine labeling, but no animals are depicted. I am confident in this observation based on the image provided.
