Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It appears to be a lion, which is part of a coat of arms or heraldic emblem featured at the top of the label. I am certain of this identification based on the visual characteristics of the image: the lion is standing upright with a front paw raised, which is a common pose in heraldry.
