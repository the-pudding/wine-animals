In the image provided, there is no depiction of any animals on the wine label. The label appears to be quite simple and elegant, primarily featuring text which includes the brand name "Girard," the type of wine which is "Chardonnay," and the region it comes from "Russian River Valley Sonoma County." There are no illustrations or graphics other than the text. I am certain of this as the image is clear and does not show any animal representations.
