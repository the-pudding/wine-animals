Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It appears to be a mythical creature that resembles a sea serpent or dragon. The creature is illustrated in a classical or heraldic art style and is part of the graphic design used for the label's branding. Given the context of it being a wine label, and the style of the artwork, it is clear that the animal is not real, but rather a stylized representation meant to add character to the label. I am certain of this interpretation based on the image provided.
