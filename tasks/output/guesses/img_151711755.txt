Yes, in the center of the label there is an image that appears to depict a lion. It's part of the coat of arms or crest featured in the design, which is a common element for wine labels to convey heritage or to symbolize the winery's history or values. I am confident in this observation based on the visual characteristics that are commonly associated with lions in heraldic imagery.
