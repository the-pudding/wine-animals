The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Champagne Vilmart & Cie. Grand Cellier Brut Premier Cru." On the label, there does appear to be a small emblem that might represent some sort of animal as part of the brand's insignia, possibly a bird or a lion based on the shape and common motifs. However, the image resolution is not high enough to confirm the exact nature of the figure depicted in the emblem with certainty.
