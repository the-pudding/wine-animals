In the image, there is no clear depiction of any animals. The label reveals various pieces of information, including the type of wine (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico), the winery (Azienda Agricola Ca' del Monte), production and bottling details, the alcohol content (15.5% vol), and the bottle size (750 ml). The illustrations appear to show grapevines or grape clusters, which are typical for a wine label, but no animals are present.
