The label depicts a rural scene with a landscape of vineyards. In the image, there is a small depiction of what appears to be a horse or a similar animal located slightly left from the center top of the label, within the scene. It's part of a very small and detailed illustration, so I can say with moderate confidence that there is an animal represented on the labelâ€”it looks like a horse or equine figure used for work in the vineyards. However, due to the small scale and artistic style of the image, the details are not absolutely clear.
