On this wine label, there are no clearly distinguishable animals present. The label features decorative elements, text displaying the wine's brand ("SCARPA"), name ("I BRICCHI"), type ("BARBERA D'ASTI"), and the designation of origin ("Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita"). The central feature is a crest or shield with a star and stripes, which is a heraldic symbol. There are ornamental vine patterns on the top but no explicit representation of animals. I am confident about my observation as the elements on the label are quite clear and distinct.
