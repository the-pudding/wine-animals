Based on the image provided, there do not appear to be any animals represented on the wine label. The label features a pattern with what seems to be stylized letters or shapes in a symmetrical arrangement. The design is quite abstract, and there are no discernible animal shapes or figures. I am quite sure there are no animals visible in this specific design.
