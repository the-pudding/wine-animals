The image shows a wine label for "DARMS LANE Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon BON PASSE VINEYARD Estate Grown." The label features a sketched landscape that appears to depict a vineyard with rows of grapevines and a small structure, possibly a building associated with the vineyard. There are no animals visible on this label. I am confident in my assessment as the image provides a clear view of the label's artwork, and it's focused on the vineyard scenery without any animal depictions.
