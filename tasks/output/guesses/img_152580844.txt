There are no animals visible on the wine label shown in the image. The label reads "Faithful Hound Stellenbosch," which suggests the name of the wine, but there are no images of animals or any other graphics depicting an animal, including a hound, on the label. The label design is quite simple with text and some subtle background pattern detail.
