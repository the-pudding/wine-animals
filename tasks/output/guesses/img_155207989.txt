No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label primarily features text and design elements that are typical for a wine bottle, such as the name of the champagne, the producer 'Barbier-Louvet', and the designation 'Grand Cru'. There are decorative elements, but they do not depict animals. I'm fairly certain in this observation based on this image.
