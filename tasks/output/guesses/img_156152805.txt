In this image, there are no animals depicted on the wine label. The label has text that reads "LA PREVOSTURA Lessona" along with the indication of "Denominazione di Origine Controllata," which suggests it is an Italian wine with a controlled designation of origin. The design is minimalist and focuses on typography without any illustrations of animals or other figures. I am certain there are no animals visible on this label.
