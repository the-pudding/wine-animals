The image shows a wine label, and I do not see any animals depicted on it. It features text and what appears to be a logo at the top with a letter "B" and a fixture that looks like a wine press or similar device. There are no graphical representations of animals on this particular label. I am very sure of this as the image is clear and the content on the label is plainly visible.
