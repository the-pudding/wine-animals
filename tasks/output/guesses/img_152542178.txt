There is no animal depicted on the wine label provided. The label features the name "ALCHEMIST," text indicating the type of wine ("CHARDONNAY") and the region ("WILLAMETTE VALLEY"), along with the alcohol content ("12.5% ALC.") and volume ("750 ml"). The graphic element appears to be a stylized symbol or icon, not an animal. I am confident in this assessment based on the visible features of the image.
