There do not appear to be any animals on the wine label. The label prominently features the name "ALCHEMIST" and below it is a stylized graphical element that does not resemble an animal. The label is for Chardonnay, indicating the type of wine in the bottle, and specifies it is from the Willamette Valley. With the information presented in the image, I can be confident that there are no animals depicted on this label.
