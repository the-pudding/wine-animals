The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "BAROLO." The label has text and design elements, but there are no visible animals on the label. It appears to be a simple and elegant wine label without any imagery of animals. I am very sure about this since the image is quite clear and there's no space where an animal image could be hidden.
