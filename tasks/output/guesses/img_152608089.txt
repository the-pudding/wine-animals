Yes, the label on the wine bottle features an image of an animal. It appears to be a horse, as evidenced by the shape of the head, mane, and the hint of a body in motion that is visible. I cannot ascertain actual presence or behavior of real animals, but the depiction on the label is reasonably clear in this case.
