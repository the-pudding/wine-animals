The image shows a wine label with the name "PANGEA" and the subtitle "Apalta Vineyard Syrah". The label features a graphic design consisting of geometric shapes that resemble abstract elements or symbols rather than a specific animal. It appears more artistic and emblematic rather than representing any particular creature. Therefore, as per the design visible, I'm quite certain that there are no distinct animals depicted on this wine label.
