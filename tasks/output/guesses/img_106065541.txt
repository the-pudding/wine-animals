The label displays a stylistic image of a cherub or putto, which is a figure resembling a chubby male child, often found in art and decorative motifs. The cherub is holding what appears to be a grapevine, which would be a common thematic element to include on a wine label, signifying the source of the wineâ€”grapes. There are no actual animals depicted in the visible part of the image. I'm confident in this assessment given the clear view of the label's artwork.
