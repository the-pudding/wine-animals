The image on the wine label appears to be an illustration of a vine or tree with twisted branches and no leaves, resembling a gnarly, old grapevine. There are no animals depicted on this label. The design is likely intentional, focusing on portraying a strong and rustic vine, which may be symbolic of the robust character of the wine itself, in this case, a Pinot Noir from Mindego Ridge in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The emphasis on the vine underscores the wine's origin and may suggest a particular quality or tradition of the vineyard.
