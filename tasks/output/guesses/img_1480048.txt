In the image, the wine label is predominantly decorated with plant-like motifs and does not clearly show any animals. The design seems to be floral or botanical, which is a common theme for wine labels as it can evoke the nature aspect of wine production. Iâ€™m quite sure there are no animals depicted on the label based on the visible elements.
