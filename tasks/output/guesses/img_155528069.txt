The image shows a wine bottle label for "Ch√¢teau Feuillet - Valle D'Aosta Traminer Aromatique." Specifically, the wine is from the Valle D'Aosta region in Italy, and the variety is Traminer Aromatique, which indicates the type of grape used to make the wine. The label does not feature any animals. Instead, it contains text providing details about the wine and an abstract logo or emblem above the name of the wine region. I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this wine label based on the image provided.
