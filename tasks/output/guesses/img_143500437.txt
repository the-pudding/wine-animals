The image features a wine bottle with a label that includes what appears to be a stylized depiction of antlers, which could suggest the image of a deer. There isn't a full animal depictedâ€”just the symbolic parts that evoke the essence of one, often used in branding to convey certain qualities like strength or elegance. I'm confident in this interpretation of the design element being present on the label.
