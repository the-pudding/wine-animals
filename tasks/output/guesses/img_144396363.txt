From this image, I do not see any animals depicted on the wine label. The label appears to focus on typography with the words "Wrath," "Ex Anima," and "Chardonnay," suggesting the name of the wine and its variety. There is also what appears to be a small illustration of a structure at the bottom right corner, but it does not resemble an animal. I am quite sure that there are no animals shown on this label based on the visible content.
