I am unable to perceive any animals on this wine label. It is a label for a wine from Burgundy, specifically a Pommard "Les Chanlins" from Thomas Morey. The label displays information typical for wine, such as the vineyard name, the appellation, and the producer, but it does not feature any animal imagery or motifs. I am very sure of this analysis based on the visible content of the label.
