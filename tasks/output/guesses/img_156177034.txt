Yes, there appear to be two animals depicted on the wine label. They look like lions, standing on their hind legs and facing a symbol between them. The depiction is stylized and heraldic, commonly seen on crests or coats of arms. I'm certain these are meant to represent lions, based on common representations in heraldry.
