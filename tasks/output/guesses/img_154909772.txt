The label features a simple graphic emblem at the top, which includes a depiction of a windmill with what might be wings or possibly blades that could be interpreted as an abstract representation of an animal, although it is not clearly defining any animal in particular. I can't be definitively sure if this is meant to represent an animal or if it's merely a part of the windmill illustration without clear animal features.
