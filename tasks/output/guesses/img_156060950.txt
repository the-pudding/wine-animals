The image shown is of a wine label for "PADRO & Co. ROJO CL√ÅSICO VERMOUTH". The label features a decorative, ornate design with no animals visible. The design comprises intricate patterns and swirls, which appear to be more floral and abstract rather than animalistic. I am confident that there are no animals depicted on this portion of the label based on the visible elements.
