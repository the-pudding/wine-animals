The label in the image is for a wine named "Clos-Saint-Denis Grand Cru" produced by Domaine St√©phane Magnien. Regarding the presence of animals on the label, I can see that the central emblem features a graphic that could be interpreted as an abstract or stylized representation of a creature, possibly with wings, reminiscent of a heraldic symbol. However, given the stylized nature of such graphics, it's not clearly an animal in the literal sense. It's rather an emblematic or ornamental element which is typical for such labels, representing the brand or the heritage of the wine estate. I'm reasonably sure there is no detailed or realistic depiction of an animal on this label.
