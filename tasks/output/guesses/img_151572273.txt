The image displays the label of a wine bottle with the name "IL CILIEGIO THE STAMPEDE VINEYARD." The graphic on the label appears to be a stylized, abstract design and does not clearly represent any specific animal. It consists of geometric shapes that might vaguely suggest a crystalline or polyhedral form. I'm quite certain that the label doesn't explicitly feature an animal in its design.
