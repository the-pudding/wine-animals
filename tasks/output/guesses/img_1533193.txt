There are no animals displayed on the wine label. The label contains text which indicates the brand and type of the wine ("BOIZEL CHAMPAGNE"), a quality designation ("Brut Réserve"), the location ("Épernay, France"), and the year "1834", which may refer to the year the winery was established or the year of tradition being highlighted. The label also includes a logo or emblem at the top, which does not depict any animals. I am confident in stating that there are no animals on this label.
