The image shows a wine label with an intricate design that features an eye. The design does not obviously depict an animal; instead, it seems to be a stylized, possibly abstract representation centered around a human eye. There is no clear depiction of whole animals within the visible part of the wine label. The patterns around the eye might be suggestive of feathers or scales to some viewers, but these interpretations are subjective and not definitive representations of an animal.
