Yes, the image on the wine label depicts a stylized animal. It appears to be a silhouette of a lion or a similar big cat, as it features a mane and a tail characteristic of such an animal. The depiction includes an element that looks like a loudspeaker or megaphone next to the animal, which could imply that the animal is roaring or making a loud sound, although the exact meaning could be open to interpretation based on the context of the label. I'm quite sure that the illustration is meant to represent an animal, specifically a lion-like figure, based on its visual features.
