In the image, the wine label features a coat of arms with intricate design elements. Within the coat of arms, there appears to be a depiction of an animal, which looks like a heraldic lion. Heraldic beasts are commonly used in coats of arms and have symbolic meanings. The presence of a lion usually symbolizes courage, nobility, royalty, strength, stateliness, and valor. I am reasonably sure that this is a stylized representation of an animal based on common heraldic imagery, but please note that this interpretation can be subjective, as the image is both stylized and small in detail.
