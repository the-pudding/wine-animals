No, there are no animals visible on the wine label. The label is primarily textual, featuring the name of the wine, "Emmolo," along with the type of wine, "Merlot," its origin "Napa Valley," and additional information about alcohol content and the winery location. The design is elegant and straightforward without any illustrations of animals. I am confident in this observation based on the image provided.
