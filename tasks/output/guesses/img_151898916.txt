The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Kalkspitz." The central graphic on the label is a stylized representation of a winemaking or agricultural emblem, possibly a rudder and pruning shears, which are tools used in vineyard management. I do not see any animals depicted on this wine label, and I am confident about this observation. The artwork and design appear to be strictly symbolic and do not include any animal imagery.
