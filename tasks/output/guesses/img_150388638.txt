There are no animals visible on the wine label in the image provided. The label is for "Travaglini Gattinara" which indicates the brand and type of wine, along with the designation of origin "Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita", which is a quality assurance label for Italian food products and wines. The label is centered around textual information and graphics that pertain to branding and origin, without any animal imagery. I am confident in this assessment based on the visual information provided in the image.
