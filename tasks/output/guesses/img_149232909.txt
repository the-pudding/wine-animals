No, there are no animals visible on this wine label. The label features an image of a person and text, specifically the name of the wine "Lady May" along with the winery "Glenelly" and the location "Stellenbosch South Africa." There is also a small emblem at the bottom, but it does not depict an animal. I am certain about my observation as no animals are present in the parts of the label that are visible.
