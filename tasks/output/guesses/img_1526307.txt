There are no animals depicted on this wine label. The image on the label shows a figure that looks to be a representation of Bacchus (also known as Dionysus in Greek mythology), who is the god of wine, festivity, and pleasure in Roman mythology. This figure appears to be a statuette or an artistic rendering rather than a live person or an animal. The label does not include any animals within its design elements.
