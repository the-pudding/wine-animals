The image you've provided shows no animals. It is a picture of a wine label for "Cuvelier Los Andes," which indicates that the wine is from Mendoza, Argentina, and is labeled as "Grand Vin." The label's design is straightforward, with text but no images of animals or any other figures. I am sure that there are no animals visible on this label based on the image provided.
