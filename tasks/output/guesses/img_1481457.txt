Based on the image you've provided, the wine label for "Champagne André Clouet Grande Réserve Brut" does not appear to depict any animals. The label features intricate ornamental designs, text, and decorative borders common in wine label design, but no animals are visible in the design. I am confident about this observation based on the visible parts of the label. If there were any animal motifs, they would typically be prominent and easily identifiable in this context.
