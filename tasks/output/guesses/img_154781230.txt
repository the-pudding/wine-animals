Yes, on the wine label, there is an image that appears to depict an animal. To the left side of the label, there is a small illustration that includes a lion, which is an emblematic figure often used on coats of arms or crests. I'm sure of the presence of an animal representation; however, it is a stylized graphic element and not a real animal.
