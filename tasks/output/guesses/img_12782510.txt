The image shows a close-up of a wine label, which appears to have text only and no visible animals. It includes the name "VELICH", which could be the brand or winery name, and a reference to a specific place and wine type, such as "Trockenbeerenauslese" and "Welschriesling". These terms indicate the wine style and grape variety, respectively. There are no animals depicted on the visible part of the label, and I am confident in my observation based on the current view. If there were any animal images, they are not shown in the cropped image provided.
