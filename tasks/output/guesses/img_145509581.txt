There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is for "Leeuwin Estate Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay" from Margaret River, which is a region in Australia known for its wine production. The label features some text, a coat of arms, and a design that seems to resemble musical notes or some form of artistic representation related to music, but there are no animals depicted. I am confident in this assessment based on the visible elements of the image provided.
