The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "South Atlantic Wines Trapiche Costa & Pampa Brut Ros√©." From what can be seen on the label, there are no animals depicted. The label design is relatively simple, with text and some graphic elements that mainly represent the brand and type of wine.

The reflections on the bottle also show a person holding a phone, presumably taking the photo, but as per the guidelines, I cannot make any particular statements about this person.
