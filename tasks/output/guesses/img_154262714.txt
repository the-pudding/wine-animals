No animals appear to be depicted on the label of this wine bottle. The design is primarily text-based with the name "EGELHOFF," the type of wine "Cabernet Sauvignon," and the location "NAPA VALLEY." There is also a small circular graphic design or emblem on the bottom right of the label, but it does not distinctly represent any animal; it looks more like a traditional emblem or seal.
