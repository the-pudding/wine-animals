Based on the image provided, there are no animals visible on the wine label. The label features text which includes the winery name "Guastaferro," the word "PRIMUM," and "taurasi," indicating the type of wine and suggesting it might be from the Taurasi DOCG in Italy. There are decorative elements in the font, but these do not depict any animals. I am confident in this observation, as there is no representation of an animal discernible in the image provided.
