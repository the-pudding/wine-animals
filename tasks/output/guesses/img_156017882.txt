The image shown is of a wine label that reads "ALTAMANA Grande Reserve MALBEC D.O MAULE - CHILE". There are no visible animals on the label itself from what we can see in this image. The label features a coat of arms or crest at the top, which is a common decorative element on wine labels and may contain symbolic elements, but in this image, the details are not clear enough to determine if there are any animals depicted within it. I am confident based on this image that there are no prominent animal figures visible on the label.
