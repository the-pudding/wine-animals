I don't see any animals on this wine label. It features text that includes the name of the wine, "La Champine," the producer "Jean-Michel Gerin," and the type of wine, "Viognier." The label design is elegant and simple, with cursive and print fonts, and there doesn't appear to be any animal imagery present. I am quite sure there are no animals depicted on this label.
