The image shows a wine label, and there are no animals visible on it. What can be seen are text elements that give information about the wine, such as the name "PLANETES de Nin," region "Priorat," and details about the vineyard "Partida 'Les Planetes' Vi de la Vila Porrera" and the family "Familia Nin-Ortiz." The label design also includes some graphical elements that resemble celestial bodies or stones, but no animals are depicted. I am entirely sure there are no animals shown on this particular wine label.
