There do not appear to be any animals on this wine label. The design is rather abstract, featuring what looks like a landscape with layers representing hills or mountains and perhaps some trees, with text above and below the imagery. The focus seems to be on the scenery rather than any depiction of animals. I am reasonably sure of this, as the image resolution allows for a clear view of the label's content.
