In the image you've provided, there is an emblem on a flag that appears to include an animal, specifically a bird which looks like a rooster or cockerel, which is a traditional symbol of France. I cannot identify real-world animals; however, I can comment on symbols and illustrations such as this one. The presence of the rooster emblem is associated with French heritage and often appears in various forms of iconography relating to the country.
