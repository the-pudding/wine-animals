The image shows a wine bottle label that reads "ALTA MORA GUARDIOLA ETNA ROSSO Denominazione di Origine Controllata". At the bottom of the label, there is a small decorative emblem that resembles a stylized swirl or spiral. Although this element could be perceived as abstract, it does not clearly represent an animal. I'm quite certain of this interpretation, as the design doesn't include definitive features that would uniquely identify it as an animal.
