Yes, there appears to be an animal on the wine label, just above the name "Br√ºndlmayer". It looks like a stylized depiction of an animal, possibly a bird, given the wing-like structures that are visible and the symmetry that suggests a bird in flight from a top-down perspective. However, due to the stylistic representation, it could also be an artistic emblem or a symbol rather than a direct representation of an actual animal. I am moderately sure that it's intended to depict an animal, but without additional context about the label's design, I cannot be absolutely certain of the specific animal it represents or the symbolism intended by the designer.
