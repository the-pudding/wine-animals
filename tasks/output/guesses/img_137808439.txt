Yes, there are animals depicted on the wine label. At the bottom of the label, there are two symmetrical images that appear to be lions. Additionally, there is an image of a bird, possibly an eagle, at the top center of the label. These depictions are stylized and form part of the label's design elements. I'm confident in this observation based on the visual elements present in the image provided.
