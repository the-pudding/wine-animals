From viewing the image, it appears that there is a depiction of an animal on the label. Above the text, within a shield-like graphic, there is an image of a creature that resembles a bird, possibly an eagle or another raptor species. It's holding a smaller figure in its talon, which seems to be a star or a cross. The certainty of the animal depiction comes from the clear illustration on the label, which is typical for many wine labels to include symbolic or heraldic animals.
