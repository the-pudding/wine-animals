Yes, there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It features a bird, specifically an eagle, as part of the coat of arms design at the center of the label. The bird is depicted with its wings spread, and it is placed above a shield containing two stars. This kind of emblematic imagery is quite common on wine labels, especially those from European regions, where heraldry plays a role in design and branding. I am sure it is an eagle based on the common heraldic representations which typically show the eagle with its wings expanded, a fierce expression, and often accompanied by other motifs like stars, as seen on this label.
