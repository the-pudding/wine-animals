Sorry, there seems to be a misunderstanding. The image is of a wine label and does not feature any animals. Instead, it features text and some graphic elements that are related to the branding and information about the wine. The text on the label provides details about the wine producer, appellation, and region. There is an illustration of what appears to be a vine or a plant, which is a common symbol associated with winemaking, but no animals are present in this image.
