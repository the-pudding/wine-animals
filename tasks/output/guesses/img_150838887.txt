Based on the image provided, the label on the wine bottle does not appear to have any animals depicted on it. The design looks like a simple line drawing that represents a mountainous landscape, possibly referencing the region where the wine originated. There do not seem to be any drawings or symbols that clearly represent animals, so I am quite sure there are no animals on this label.
