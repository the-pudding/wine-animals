I don't see any animals on the wine label shown in the image. The label primarily features text, including the name of the wine "Obra Prima Malbec Reserva," and the name of the producer "Familia Cassone." There is also a simple graphic representation of a building or a house at the top of the label. I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this label.
