The image shows a wine label for Ch√¢teau Gazin Pomerol. In terms of visible animals, this label primarily features ornate decorative patterns and a detailed illustration of what seems to be a vineyard estate. There are no clearly identifiable animals present in this design; it focuses on the chateau and surrounding vineyard landscape, along with textual information about the wine. The depiction is quite intricate and stylistic, but within the resolution and clarity of this image, no animals can be discerned. I am fairly confident in this assessment based on the visible content of the label.
