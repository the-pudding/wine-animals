There are no animals depicted on the wine label in the image you've provided. The central image on the label is a tree, which seems to be a tamarack tree given the name "TAMARACK CELLARS" at the top of the label. The graphic representation does not include any animals. I am confident in this assessment based on the visual information available in the image.
