This is an image of a wine bottle with a label that indicates it is a "Chianti Classico Riserva 2012" from "Bucciarelli." It is described as "vino biologico," which means organic wine. The label features a simple line drawing of what appears to be a rural scene, possibly a farmstead or winery.

As for animals on the label, I can see what appears to be a rooster on top of what might be a barrel or a railing in the artwork. I cannot confirm with 100% certainty that it is a rooster because the image and the drawing style are quite stylized, but given the traditional iconography associated with Chianti, where a black rooster (Gallo Nero) is a historic symbol of the Chianti Classico wine region, it is very likely that the animal depicted is intended to represent a rooster.
