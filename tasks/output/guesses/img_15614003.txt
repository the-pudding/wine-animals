No, I do not see any animals on the wine label in the image provided. The label is primarily textual, featuring the name of the wine and vineyard, the type of wine ("Porto Tawny"), the region where it's produced, and other production and branding information. There is a graphic design element in the center which appears to be a stylized emblem or crest, but it does not depict any animals. I am quite sure there are no animals on this label based on the image provided.
