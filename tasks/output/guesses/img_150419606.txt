Yes, there appears to be an animal depicted on the wine label. In the emblem displayed on the label, there is a drawing of a lion. Given the stylized nature of such depictions on labels, which are often meant to represent crests or symbols associated with the vineyard or region, I am quite certain that it is intended to represent a lion.
