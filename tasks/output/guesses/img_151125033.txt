I do not see any animals on this wine label. The design appears to consist mainly of floral elements, with the name "botani" prominently featured along with the type of wine, which is Garnacha. There are illustrations of flowers and what seems to be botanical motifs, but no animals are visible in this image. I am quite sure of this observation based on the image provided.
