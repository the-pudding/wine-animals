I do not see any clear depiction of animals on the wine label provided in the image. The label has text and what appears to be a decorative element above the "P" in "PRAT SURA," but it is not distinctly an animal. Instead, it looks more like a stylistic flourish or a logo. I am quite sure there are no explicit representations of animals on this label based on the image shown.
