No, there are no animals on this wine label. The label is for Champagne Agrapart & Fils, and it seems to be a Blanc de Blancs variety. The label features some text, presumably information about the wine, and a small emblem at the top that does not resemble an animal. I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this label.
