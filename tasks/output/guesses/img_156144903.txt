No, there are no animals depicted on this wine label. The label features an image of a sailboat with several sails set against a simple background. The name "Clos Floridene" is prominently displayed along with the subtext "Grand vin de Graves" and the names Denis & Florence Dubourdieu. The overall design is elegant and does not include any animal imagery. I am certain of this observation as there are no elements on the label that resemble an animal.
