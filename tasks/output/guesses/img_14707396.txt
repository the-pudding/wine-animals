Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals on the wine label. The label contains text that reads "Klein Constantia," "Vin de Constance," and "Natural Sweet Wine, WINE OF SOUTH AFRICA," along with decorative elements. The label design includes ornate detailing but does not depict animals. I am confident in this observation.
