The image displays a wine label, and based on the visible design, there are no animals depicted on this label. The central graphic element appears to be a stylized image of a structure, likely representing a building or estate, which is commonly used to symbolize the winery or estate where the wine is produced. There are no animal shapes or figures readily apparent in this design, so I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this wine label.
