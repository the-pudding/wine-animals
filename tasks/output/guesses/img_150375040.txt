Based on the image provided, the wine label for "ALION," there are no animals depicted. The label features text, a shield with a crown on top and a letter "M" inside, as well as some additional decorative elements, but no animal images are visible on the label. I am confident in this observation as the image is clear and all elements are discernible.
