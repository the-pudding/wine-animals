The image you've provided is of a wine label for "Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay" from California. There are no animals visible on this label. What is featured prominently at the center is a stylized graphic of grape leaves and vines, which is a common motif for wine labels, symbolizing the grapevines used in winemaking. There are no animals or creature-like figures in this graphic; it's purely botanical. I am confident in this assessment.
