The image displays a wine label that features a stylized illustration of a person riding a horse, and there is also what appears to be an owl sitting on the person's outstretched arm. The depiction of these animals is done in a graphic, almost heraldic style that is typical for wine labels and other types of branding, adding an element of elegance or tradition to the product's presentation. The owl and horse are clearly identifiable as animals.
