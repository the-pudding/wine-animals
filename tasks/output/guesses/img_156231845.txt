The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "BODEGAS LA CARTUJA Priorat". There is a crest-like graphic at the top of the label, and within that graphic, there are no discernible animals. The crest includes a drawing of what appears to be a building or architectural feature and grapevines, both common symbols associated with wine but not animals. I am quite sure there are no animals depicted on this label based on this image.
