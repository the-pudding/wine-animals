The image is of a wine bottle with a label that reads "Tenute Silvio Nardi," which mentions "Brunello di Montalcino," indicating that the wine is of that specific variety from Italy. At the top of the label, there is an emblem that includes an animal figure which appears to be a lion or a similar beast, often a symbol of nobility or strength in emblematic imagery. I can say with confidence that there is a stylized representation of an animal on the label.
