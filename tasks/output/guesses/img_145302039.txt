The image appears to be a wine label for a wine named "Attilio Ghisolfi Barolo Bussia" from Monforte d'Alba. On the label, there is an illustration of a person holding onto what looks like a balloon or a floating spherical object with strings or ropes attached, suggesting a hot air balloon or a whimsical, artistic representation. There are no animals visible on the label itself. The label presents a stylized and elegant design, typical for wine branding to convey a sense of sophistication and quality. I am confident in my assessment, as I can analyze the visible elements of the image provided.
