Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals depicted on the wine label. The label text focuses on information pertaining to the wine, including its region of origin ("Product of France," "Grand Vin de Bourgogne"), the wine type ("BEAUNE PREMIER CRU - LES CENT VIGNES"), and the producer ("PATRIARCHE PÃ¨re & Fils"). The logo at the top center of the label consists of a stylized monogram and does not contain any clear animal shapes. I am quite sure of my observation, as the elements present on the label are typical for wine branding and do not feature any animal imagery.
