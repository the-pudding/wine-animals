The image on the wine label depicts a series of stylized, symmetrical tree silhouettes that could reminiscent of antlers due to their branching nature, which might be where the idea of animals could come in. However, these are not actual animals; they are graphics designed to look like vine or tree branches forming a pattern. I am confident in this interpretation as there are no discernible animal features presentâ€”just abstract, plant-like designs.
