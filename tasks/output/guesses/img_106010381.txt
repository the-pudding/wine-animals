There are no animals visible on the wine label in the image you have shared. The label is for Sophenia Synthesis Malbec, a wine from Tupungato, Mendoza, Argentina. The design is elegant and appears to focus on typography and branding without any animal imagery. I am certain of this, as there are no animal shapes or illustrations present on the label.
