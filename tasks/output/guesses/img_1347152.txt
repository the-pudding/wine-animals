There are no animals visible on the wine label provided. The label features an illustration of a building which appears to be a chateau, with the name "Château Pontet-Canet" prominently displayed. It states "Grand Cru Classé en 1855" above the illustration, indicating its classification, and "Pauillac" below, suggesting the region where the wine is from. Additionally, there are names at the bottom of the label, which I will not disclose due to privacy reasons. There are no images of animals or other discernible figures besides the architectural drawing.
