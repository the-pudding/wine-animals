On this wine label, there is a coat of arms that features a lion on the left side, which is a common heraldic symbol. This lion appears to be stylized and is part of the graphic design. It is not a real, living animal but an artistic representation often used to symbolize strength, courage, and nobility. I am confident in my assessment as the image presents a clear depiction of a heraldically styled lion.
