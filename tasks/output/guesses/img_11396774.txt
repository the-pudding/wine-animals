There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label displays text, including the brand name "SCHNAITMANN" and the name "SIMONROTH," followed by "CUVÃ‰E D," indicating the type of wine. The design is clean and minimalistic, with no animal graphics or illustrations present. I can state with certainty that there are no animals depicted on this label.
