The image you provided appears to be of a wine bottle label, which is specifically for "Alvear Solera 1927 Pedro Ximénez" from the Montilla-Moriles Denominación de Origen. In this image, there are no visible animals on the label. The design is quite simple, featuring text and a small coat of arms or crest, which is common on wine labels to signify the brand or lineage. I am confident in stating that there are no animals depicted on this part of the wine label.
