I don't see any animals on this wine label. The label is quite clear, and the main features include the name of the wine, "Chateau Lynch-Bages," and additional details such as "Grand Vin," "Grand Cru Classe," and "Pauillac." There is also an emblem and some designs on the sides that resemble seals or crests, but there are no animals depicted on the label.
