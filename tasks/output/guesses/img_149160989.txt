I don't see any animals on this wine label. The label features the name "MIL PIEDRAS" and below it mentions "by Benvenuto de la Serna," indicating the wine producer. It also states the type of wine, which is "CABERNET SAUVIGNON," and the region "VISTAFLORES MENDOZA ARGENTINA," indicating where it's from. The design includes a row of stones, aligning with the name "Mil Piedras," which translates to "a thousand stones" in Spanish. There are no graphics or illustrations of animals present on the label. I am certain of this assessment based on the visual information provided in the image.
