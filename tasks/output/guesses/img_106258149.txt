No, there are no animals on this wine label. The label is primarily textual and provides information about the wine, including the brand name "ALEXANDRO," the type of wine "Sherry Jerez Xérès Cream," and details such as it being a product of Spain, its alcohol content, and volume. There are decorative elements and patterns on the label, but they do not include any animals. I am certain of this as the image is quite clear and shows the details on the label without any ambiguity.
