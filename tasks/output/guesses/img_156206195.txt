The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Enrique Mendoza La TREMENDA Monastrell ALICANTE DENOMINACION DE ORIGEN ESTATE BOTTLED". There are no visible animals on the label; it features primarily text in different fonts and sizes. The design is quite minimalistic and does not include any illustrations or images besides the text. I am certain that there are no animals depicted on this particular label.
