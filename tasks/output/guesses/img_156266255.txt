I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The image provided is a picture of a wine label and I do not have the capability to see images. However, generally speaking, wine labels may or may not contain images, including those of animals, depending on the design chosen by the winery. Without the ability to view the image, I cannot comment on whether there is an animal on this particular label. If you are able to see the image and have a question about its contents or design, feel free to describe what you see and I will do my best to provide information or answer any questions you may have.
