The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "PERINET PRIORAT DOQ". In the center of the label, there is a crest or emblem that features a design that appears to include a lion on the left side. This lion is part of the emblem design on the label, intended to represent a symbol or crest, rather than an actual photograph of an animal. My assertion is based on common practices in label design where crests and emblems are used to convey heritage, quality, or origin.
