In the image of the wine label, there are no animals depicted. The label features text related to the wine itself, including the type, vintage (2014), and the region (Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru - Les Feusselottes). Additionally, there is an illustration of what appears to be a building or estate. The label does not have any artwork or illustrations of animals. I'm confident in this observation based on the visible contents of the image.
