Yes, the wine label features an illustration of a dog. The dog appears to be part of the brand's identity, as evident by the name "BARKING MAD" displayed prominently above the image of the dog. I'm quite certain it's an animal illustration because it has recognizable features such as eyes, ears, and nose typical of a dog.
