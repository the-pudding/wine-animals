The image you've provided is of a wine label from "Chateau La Fleur de Gay". On this label, there's an artistic representation that includes floral and foliage motifs. There are no animals depicted on this label. I'm certain there are no animals as the main elements are ornamental and decorative, typical for a design that might be found on wine labels to convey elegance and refinement.
