Yes, the wine label appears to have two animals depicted as heraldic supporters on either side of the shield. These are likely to be mythical or symbolic creatures rather than specific real animals, which is a common feature in heraldry. The image is not clear enough to identify them with absolute certainty, but they appear to be stylized versions of lions or similar beasts, given their mane-like features and posture commonly associated with regality and strength. I am reasonably sure of this observation based on common heraldic imagery.
