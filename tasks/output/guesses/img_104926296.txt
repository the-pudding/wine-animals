Yes, there are animals depicted on the wine label. On either side of the label, there are illustrations of what appear to be lions, which are conventional elements in heraldry. These lions are stylized and represented in the context of a coat of arms on the label, contributing to an elegant and traditional branding. I am quite sure about this observation due to the distinct features of the lions, such as their manes and the placement in a heraldic pose.
