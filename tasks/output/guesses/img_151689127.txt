Yes, there is an illustration of an animal on the wine labelâ€”it depicts a stylized giraffe standing on its hind legs and holding a glass of wine. This type of imagery is often used for branding or artistic purposes on product labels. I am certain as it is clearly visible and meant for decorative or branding purposes.
