The image shows a wine bottle label for Spy Valley Pinot Noir from Southern Valleys, Marlborough, New Zealand. On this part of the label, there are no visible animals depicted; it is primarily text and branding elements. I am certain of this from the visible portion of the label shown in the image. However, if there is artwork on other parts of the bottle not visible in this image, I cannot confirm the presence or absence of animal imagery there.
