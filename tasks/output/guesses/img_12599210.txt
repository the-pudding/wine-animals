The image appears to be the label of a wine bottle, with the name "MACCHIONA" prominently displayed in red font, followed by "LA STOPPA" in black font below it. The background of the label features a black and white drawing of what seems to be a rural scene, possibly a vineyard with rows of plants leading up to a building or house in the center. Regarding animals, I do not see any clear depiction of animals on this label; there are no obvious shapes or illustrations that suggest the presence of an animal.
