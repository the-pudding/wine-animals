In the image, there is a coat of arms featuring a heraldic design common to such emblems. This includes a shield, decorative elements around the shield, and what appears to be a stylized fleur-de-lis at the top. The specific elements in the shield consist of patterns and colors, but there are no clearly distinguishable animals present in the coat of arms on this wine label. The label conveys a sense of tradition and heritage, which is typical for European wine producers who often use such imagery to denote the history and origin of their wine.
