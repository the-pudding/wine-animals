There do not appear to be any animals on the wine label. The image on the label depicts a human figure surrounded by grape vines and clusters, which seems fitting for a bottle of wine, especially one from Napa Valley. There are no discernible animal figures in this particular design. I'm quite confident in this observation, as the focus of the imagery is clearly on the person and the vines.
