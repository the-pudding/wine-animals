Based on the image provided, the wine label features a landscape design. There are no clear or distinct animals visible in this design. The main elements depicted are what appear to be a flowing river, mountains in the distance, and a forest of evergreen trees. The art style is somewhat abstract, so the renderings are not highly detailed but convey the essence of a natural scene. I am confident in this assessment based on the image provided.
