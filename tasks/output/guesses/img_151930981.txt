The wine label in the image features an illustration of a rural scene with a house and what appears to be vineyards or fields surrounding it. There are no visible animals on the wine label itself. I can assert this with confidence based on the displayed image. If an animal were present, it would typically be depicted within the illustrated scene or as part of the graphic elements on the label, neither of which appear in this image.
