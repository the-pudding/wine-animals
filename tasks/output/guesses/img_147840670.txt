The image on the wine label seems to be an abstract or stylized representation of a vineyard or some form of plantation, rather than any clear depiction of an animal. The lines appear to converge towards a central point, possibly suggesting rows of plants or trees, which is a common theme for wine labels to reflect the origin of the wine. There are no distinct animals visible on this label. I am fairly confident in this observation as the details on the label seem to be more agricultural and related to viticulture rather than depicting wildlife or animals.
