Yes, the wine label features the image of an animal, specifically the eyes that resemble those of a wolf. Given that "Lobo" means wolf in Spanish, and the graphic design on the label is intended to evoke the presence of this animal, it is a deliberate artistic representation. I am confident in this interpretation of the image on the label.
