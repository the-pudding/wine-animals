Yes, on the wine label there is an illustration that appears to depict a dog lying down. The style of the artwork is somewhat abstract and sketch-like, so while it seems to be an animal, it's based on the stylized representation. I cannot be 100% certain due to the abstract nature of the illustration, but the shape and general form suggest that it is intended to represent a dog.
