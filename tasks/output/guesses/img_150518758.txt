The image you provided is a wine bottle label, and it does not feature any animals. The label is text-based, with various details such as the name of the winery, "Tenuta di Ghizzano," the name of the wine, "Veneroso," and additional information including the designation "Terre di Pisa DOC," indicating it is a red wine made with organic grapes and the specific controlled designation of origin. The design is simple and lacks any illustrations or depictions of animals. I am certain of this since I am analyzing the image provided and there are no visual elements suggesting the presence of animals.
