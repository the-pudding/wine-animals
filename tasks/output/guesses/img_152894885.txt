The wine label shows a detailed illustration that includes a tree and various figures that seem to depict humans engaged in activities around the tree. There are no clear animals depicted in the visible section of the label. The intricate drawing style could potentially hide small details, but from what is visible, I can't confidently point out any animal figures.
