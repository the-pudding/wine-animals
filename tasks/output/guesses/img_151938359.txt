The label displays the name "Markus Molitor," the words "Alte Reben" followed by "Riesling Mosel," suggesting the type of wine, which is a Riesling from the Mosel region. At the top of the label, there is a line drawing of a building, which appears to be a winery or estate associated with Markus Molitor. There are no animals visible on this wine label. I am certain of this, as the image provided is clear and shows the entire label.
