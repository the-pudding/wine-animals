No, there are no animals on this wine label. The design consists of graphic symbols of eyes ("occhi" in Italian). The name "Quattrochi" seems to play off the word "quattro," meaning "four" in Italian, and "occhi," meaning "eyes," given that there are four eyes represented on the label. I'm quite sure there are no animals depicted here.
