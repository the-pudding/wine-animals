Yes, there appears to be an emblem with an animal on the label at the top, which resembles two birds—potentially eagles—facing each other with wings spread. This is a common type of heraldic or emblematic design, and in this instance, it likely serves as a symbol or logo for the brand. I am confident in this observation based on the design elements present in the image.
