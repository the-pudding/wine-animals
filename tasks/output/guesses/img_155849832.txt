Based on the image provided, there are no animals visible on the wine label. It features text, including "Vin de Bourgogne," indicating it is a Burgundy wine, and the name "Santenay Clos des Champs Carafe" along with "Antoine Olivier," which is likely the producer's name. The design includes a circular green graphic, but no animals are depicted. I am confident of this observation since the image is clear and shows the label in its entirety.
