In the image, on the wine label, there are two animals depicted in the upper part of the label, in the crest above the text. They appear to be lions standing on either side of a shield, which is a common emblematic detail used in heraldry. I'm sure these are artistic, stylized representations of lions and not actual photographical images of animals.
