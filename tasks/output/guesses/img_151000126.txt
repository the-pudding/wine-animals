I don't see any animals on the wine label. The label features an illustration of a person holding a wine glass and a top hat. The design is reminiscent of a vintage poster, with decorative elements and text that provides information about the wine. Since the resolution and details are clear, I am confident that there are no animals depicted on this label.
