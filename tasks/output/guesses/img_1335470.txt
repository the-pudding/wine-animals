The image shows a wine label for "Château Chasse-Spleen" indicating it is a wine from the Moulis-en-Médoc region of France. The artwork features a detailed illustration of a building, presumably the Château itself. There are no clear depictions of animals on the label; the image predominantly features architectural artwork.

Based on the information available in the image, I am confident that there is no conspicuous depiction of an animal on the label. If there are any subtle design elements that could be interpreted as animals, they are not clearly visible in this image.
