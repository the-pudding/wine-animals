The label depicts a pastoral scene with a vineyard. There are no visible animals on the label. The focus is on the landscape and the vineyard itself, suggesting a serene and natural setting which is typical for wine labels to convey a sense of origin and quality of the wine. I can say with confidence that there are no animals depicted on this wine label.
