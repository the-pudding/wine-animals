There are no animals visible on this wine label. The label is for "Rutherford Hill Cabernet Sauvignon" from the Napa Valley appellation, and it indicates that the winery is family owned and sustainably farmed. The artwork on the label depicts the fa√ßade of a building with a gate, but there are no discernible animal figures. I am certain that there are no animals on this particular label based on the image provided.
