In the image, you've provided a label on a bottle of wine. Specifically, the label reads "Amarone della Valpolicella Classico" which is a type of red wine from the Valpolicella region in the Veneto, Italy, known for its rich, full-bodied flavors. The label also includes the designation "Denominazione di Origine Controllata," indicating it meets specific quality and production standards.

As for your question about animals, there is no clear depiction of an animal on the front visible part of the label. It features text and some decorative elements, such as a crest or emblem with the letter "Z," which is likely associated with the winery's branding (Zenato, as written at the bottom of the label), but based on what is visible, there are no animals. I am confident in this observation based on the visible part of the image provided.
