Yes, on the wine label, there is an illustration of a horse. It is depicted in a stylized, somewhat abstract manner in a reddish color, placed above the text. I can say with certainty that the image features a horse because of its recognizable shape, including what appear to be a mane and tail, despite the abstract style of the illustration.
