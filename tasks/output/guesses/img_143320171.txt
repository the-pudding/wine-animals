In the image provided, I do not see any animals depicted on the wine label. The label primarily consists of text and geometric decorative elements. The text indicates that the wine is a Tempranillo variety named RIVAREY, from the Crianza 2016 vintage, and it is a product of Spain, specifically from the Rioja wine region which is known for its high-quality wines. There are no visible illustrations or graphics resembling animals on this label. I am confident about this observation given the clarity of the image provided.
