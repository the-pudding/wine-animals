There are no animals visible on the wine label. The label is for "Tyrrell's Wines" and indicates that it is a Hunter Valley Chardonnay. There is a logo at the top that includes a geometric design possibly representing a letter or symbol, but it is not an animal representation. I am certain of this as there are no distinct animal features or shapes present in the design.
