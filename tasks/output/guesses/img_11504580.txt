I do not see any animals depicted on this wine label. The label is primarily text with some design elements. I'm quite sure there are no animals visible in this image; it features the name "BRIZIARELLI Vitruvio" and the text "MONTEFALCO SAGRANTINO" below, which refers to a specific type of wine, along with "DENOMINAZIONE DI ORIGINE CONTROLLATA E GARANTITA," indicating that the wine has a controlled designation of origin guarantee.
