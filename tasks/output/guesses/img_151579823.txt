Yes, there is an image of an animal on the wine label. It appears to be a cat sitting atop a cluster of grapes. The representation is quite clear and artistic, and I am quite sure it is meant to depict a cat, given the distinctive features such as the pointed ears, feline body shape, and the position typically associated with a sitting cat.
