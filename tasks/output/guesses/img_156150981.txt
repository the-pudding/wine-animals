The label features an emblem with a stylized image that appears to be a turtle. A turtle is an animal, so yes, there is an animal depicted on this label. I'm certain about this because the turtle is a recognizable symbol often associated with longevity and stability, which might be used metaphorically in the context of a wine label to signify the wine's qualities or the winery's values.
