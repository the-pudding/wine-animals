{"id":"167958979","responseA":"The image displays a wine label with the name "SETZER" prominently in the center. The label includes a depiction of a stylized animal that appears to be a horse with a flowing mane, positioned next to a cluster of grapes. This representation of a horse is artistic rather than a real animal. I am certain (1) that the image is a graphical design element of the label and not a photograph of a real animal.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse", "certainty": 1}"}
