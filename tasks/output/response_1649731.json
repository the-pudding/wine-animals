{"id":"1649731","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle label for "DELA FORCE Fine Ruby Port," established in 1868. The label showcases a crest with an illustration that appears to be a griffin, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. As this is a stylized depiction and the image is clear, I am certain about my observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1. There are no visible people or real animals on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "griffin","certainty": 1}"}
