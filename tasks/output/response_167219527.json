{"id":"167219527","responseA":"The image displays a bottle of Max Reserva Chardonnay from the Errazuriz winery. The label features the name of the wine, the type of grape, and some information about the terroir, indicating it comes from schist soils and a cool climate terroir in Aconcagua Costa, Chile, with a statement about the winery's family heritage since 1870. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; instead, there is an illustration of what appears to be the winery or estate. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say I am at 1 for certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
