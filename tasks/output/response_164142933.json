{"id":"164142933","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on the wine label in the image. It is a label for "Ch√¢teau de Meursault Meursault - Clos des Grands Charrons Monopole" wine. The label features a coat of arms with a fleur-de-lis, which is a stylized lily that is often associated with French heraldry, but it does not depict any animals or humans. I am very certain of this assessment; thus, on a scale of 0-1 with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
