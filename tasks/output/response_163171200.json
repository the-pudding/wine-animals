{"id":"163171200","responseA":"The label on the bottle features a series of images, but I don't see any that clearly depict an entire animal or human. There is a close-up shot of what appears to be an eye, which could be that of an animal, but since it's a close-up and out of context, I cannot definitively classify it as an animal or human. Regarding certainty, since I cannot fully discern the context of the close-up eye, I would say my certainty is around 0.5.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.5}"}
