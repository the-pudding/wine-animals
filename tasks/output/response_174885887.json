{"id":"174885887","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that reads "SAN PIETRO ALTO ADIGE Pinot Grigio." The label features an illustration of a landscape, likely a vineyard or rural area, which is a common theme for wine labels to convey the origin or the tradition of the wine. There do not appear to be any animals or humans in the illustration on the label; it mainly features buildings and possibly some vegetation or geographical features in the background. I am very certain about my observations, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would say my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
