{"id":"172674656","responseA":"In the image, there appears to be both a human figure and an animal. The human figure looks like a classical representation of a woman, possibly denoting an allegorical or mythological figure given the context and styling. Adjacent to her is an animal that resembles a bear. The illustration is done in a style that suggests craftsmanship and tradition, which is often used in wine label design to convey a sense of quality and heritage.Regarding certainty, I would say I'm quite certain about the identification of the figures, so a 1 on your scale for both the human and the animal present in the illustration.","responseB":"{"animal": "bear, human", "certainty": 1}"}
