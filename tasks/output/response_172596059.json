{"id":"172596059","responseA":"The image shows a wine label, and the central feature appears to be a stylized design or symbol that might represent a flower or a similar motif, but it's not clear or detailed enough to make out specific animals or humans from this element alone. Based on the given image, I don't see any explicit representation of animals or humans. My certainty level is 0.9, as there is always a small possibility that an extremely stylized representation could be interpreted differently by someone else.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.9}"}
