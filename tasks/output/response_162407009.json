{"id":"162407009","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Marques de Arviza Selecci√≥n Especial." There are illustrations that resemble grapevines and a shield or crest, which is typical for wine labels to suggest heritage or quality. I do not see any distinct images of animals or humans on this label. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1, I am very certain there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
