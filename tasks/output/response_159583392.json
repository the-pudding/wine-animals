{"id":"159583392","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Canchales Vino Joven" from the Rioja region. The label depicts a rural scene with a vineyard and buildings, which might suggest it is an illustration of the winery or the region where the wine is produced. There do not appear to be any clear images of animals or humans on the label; what is visible is an artistic representation of a landscape associated with wine production. My certainty level regarding the absence of clear animal or human depictions is 1, meaning I am very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
