{"id":"6489674","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the text "AL PASSO" and "TOLAINI" prominently displayed. There's an illustration of a landscape that appears to be a stylized hill with rows that could be vineyards and a group of trees at the top of the hill. Below the hill, there's a small figure that resembles a person. There are no clear depictions of animals on this label. On a scale of 0 to 1 for certainty about the depiction of a human, I would say I am 0.8 certain that the figure represents a person, considering the stylized nature of the image. It is not a detailed or realistic representation of a human, but the form suggests the abstract idea of a person.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.8}"}
