{"id":"170103483","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that features a graphic design, but no clear depiction of animals or humans. The design includes a beehive, grapes, and leaves, which are typical symbols associated with wine, nature, and the process of winemaking. There is also text on the label that provides information about the wine, such as the brand name "HONIG," the region "NAPA VALLEY RUTHERFORD," and the type of wine "SAUVIGNON BLANC LATE HARVEST." I am very certain (1) about my assessment regarding the absence of animals or humans in the depiction on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
