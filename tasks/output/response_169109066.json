{"id":"169109066","responseA":"Yes, I see an image on the label that appears to be two small figures that could be interpreted as either humans or mythological creatures intertwined or back-to-back, typical of heraldic or decorative symbols often found on such labels. I cannot provide a certain classification as the image is stylized and not detailed, but it's not uncommon for wine labels to feature such designs. My certainty level is around 0.7, considering the common usage of such symbols on wine labels and the artistic representation that makes it look like figures.","responseB":"{  "animal": "humans or mythological creatures",  "certainty": 0.7}"}
