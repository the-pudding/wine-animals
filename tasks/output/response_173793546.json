{"id":"173793546","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features a drawing of a building, specifically a classical structure that might be associated with a winery or estate. The text on the label indicates it is a Bourgogne Chardonnay, with additional information suggesting it is a limited production ("tirage limité à 1427 bouteilles"). My certainty level that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label is 1 (very certain).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
