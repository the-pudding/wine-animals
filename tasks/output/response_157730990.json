{"id":"157730990","responseA":"The image displays a label from a bottle of "Marqués de Cáceres Brut". On the label, there is a crest that includes a lion, which is a stylized animal, not a real one. The crest is a common element in heraldry and does not depict any real animals or humans. I am very certain about my assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
