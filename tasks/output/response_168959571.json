{"id":"168959571","responseA":"The wine label shows a stylized image of a set of scales, which is often associated with balance, justice, and law. The image in the center of the scales resembles a simplified stick figure of a human, implying a person in a highly abstract form. As to the certainty rating, I would say 1 for being certain that the label represents an abstract human figure. It is a creative representation that uses the negative space for the figure's head and arms in the form of a horizontal line and the scales to imply the figure's body. There are no animals shown in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
