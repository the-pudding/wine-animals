{"id":"169102055","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to have a stylized human figure, as evident from the presence of arms, legs, and what seems to be long flowing hair. The figure is also holding up a bunch of grapes, which is commonly associated with wine labels to symbolize vineyards or wine production. There are no obvious animals present in this design. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
