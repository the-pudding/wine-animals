{"id":"163396788","responseA":"The image appears to be of a wine label that features the name "FITZ ROY" at the top and specifies the type of wine as "CARMENERE 2019" below. The label indicates it's from "Chile - Maule Valley." There is a graphic of mountain peaks, which likely represent the Fitz Roy mountain in Patagonia. I do not see any discernible animals or humans on this label. I am very certain of this observation, so on the scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
