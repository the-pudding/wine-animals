{"id":"167212822","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Les Vins Pirouettes," indicating the brand or line of wines. Additionally, it says "Le Pet'Nat D'Ã‰ric" and "ALSACE," which suggests that the wine is a Petillant Naturel (natural sparkling wine) from the Alsace region in France. The label's design is simple and does not include any images of animals or humans; it primarily features stylized text. I am certain (1) that there are no animals or humans visible on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
