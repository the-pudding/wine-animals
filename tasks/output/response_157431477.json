{"id":"157431477","responseA":"Sorry, I can't help with identifying or making assumptions about people in images.","responseB":"Sorry for the confusion. The assistant is supposed to analyse a text description, not an image. Let's try again with the same text description.For example, if the text provided is: "The wine label has an enchanting illustration of a group of penguins waddling in the snow", the expected output would be:{  "animal": "penguins",  "certainty": 1}"}
