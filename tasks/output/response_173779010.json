{"id":"173779010","responseA":"The label features a crest with what appears to be two stylized animals on either side of a shield with a diagonal band. These animals are part of a traditional heraldic design and are not real. They could be interpreted as dragons, griffins, lions, or similar mythical or heraldic creatures often used in such emblems. I am very certain (1) that there are no real animals or humans on this label, and the representation is purely decorative and symbolic.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
