{"id":"155580456","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to be that of a human figure dressed in what looks like historical clothing, possibly a robe and holding a staff or similar object. The style suggests it might be a representation of a historical or mythological personage, often typical for wine label artwork. There are no animals visible on the label. I would say with a certainty of 1 that the figure is a human representation.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 1}"}
