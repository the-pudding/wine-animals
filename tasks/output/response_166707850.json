{"id":"166707850","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features the word "LAVA" prominently at the top, with a graphic that resembles a splatter, possibly to evoke the idea of volcanic activity, which aligns with the theme suggested by "Terre del Vulcano" at the bottom. I am very certain that there are no animals or humans displayed on this label, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I am at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
