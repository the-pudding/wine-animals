{"id":"149644611","responseA":"On the wine label, there is a stylized image of a human figure riding a horse. The human figure appears to be holding a tool or weapon, possibly a sickle or hammer, and also a wing is visible on the side of the figure, which might suggest a mythical or legendary character. Additionally, the figure is holding what seems to be a bird's skull. There are no real animals or humans on the label; it's just artwork. I am very certain about these observations, so on the scale of certainty, I'd rate it as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
