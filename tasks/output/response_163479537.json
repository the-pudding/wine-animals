{"id":"163479537","responseA":"The label features an abstract illustration that could be interpreted as both a human figure and an animal figure depending on the perspective of the viewer. The upper part appears to resemble a human in a dynamic pose, while the lower part has features reminiscent of an animal, possibly a bird, with the suggestion of wings and a tail. My certainty level for this observation is 1, as the depiction is clearly designed to be ambiguous and open to interpretation, thus it contains elements of both.","responseB":"{"animal": "human, bird", "certainty": 1}"}
