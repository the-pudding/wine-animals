{"id":"160663662","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Barbaresco" wine from "TENUTE CISA ASINARI DEI MARCHESI DI GRESY." There appears to be a coat of arms or crest at the top of the label featuring what seems like a heraldic design, which might include animals in its design as is common in heraldry, but it is not detailed enough in the image to identify them with certainty. Given the context and what is typically featured on a wine label, it is unlikely to depict any real animals or humans directly. I would say with a certainty of 0.7 that there are no real animals or humans depicted on the label, just a graphic or illustration that may symbolically include animals as part of the heraldic crest.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.7}"}
