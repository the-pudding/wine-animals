{"id":"1940435","responseA":"Yes, this wine label features a drawing of an animal â€” it looks like a depiction of a mythical creature, which has the body of a lion and may have wings, suggesting it could be a griffin or a similar mythical creature. There are no human figures on the label. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "griffin",  "certainty": 1}"}
