Apologies for the misunderstanding, but as a text-based AI model, I currently lack the capability to view or process any actual images or visually analyze a wine label. Instead, I can generate responses based on textual information provided to me. If you describe the wine label to me, I'll do my best to deliver accurate answers to your questions.
