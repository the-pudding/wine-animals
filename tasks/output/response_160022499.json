{"id":"160022499","responseA":"The wine label shows an illustration of a landscape, likely a vineyard, with rows of vines and a building on a hill, which may represent a winery or estate. Above the illustration is a logo or emblem that includes a silhouette that could be interpreted as a stylized animal or a decorative design. There are no clear or recognizable images of humans or animals. My certainty level regarding the absence of clear images of humans or animals on this label is 1, as there's no explicit representation of such figures in the picture provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
