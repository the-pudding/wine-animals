{"id":"141617037","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "SIMI Since 1876" and "Sonoma Zinfandel." The label features a vintage-looking illustration of what appears to be a winery or related building. There are no animals or humans on the label that are clearly visible. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals and humans on the label is 1, meaning I am very certain based on the visible content of the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
