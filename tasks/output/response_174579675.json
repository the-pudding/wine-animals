{"id":"174579675","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. The focus is on the branding and information about the wine. The label clearly states "Stellar Organics" and mentions that there are "No Added Sulfites" in the wine, which is Pinotage. It also specifies that the grapes used are organically grown, ethically produced, and fairly traded, with a mention of South Africa, indicating the region of production. The central feature seems to be a geometric or floral design, which does not represent an animal or human. I am 1 (very certain) there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
