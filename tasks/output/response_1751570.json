{"id":"1751570","responseA":"The image shows a wine label denoted as "Chateau Clerc Milon". On the label, there are depictions of two figures that appear to be humans. They are styled in a way that is reminiscent of traditional European costumes that might be found in a period piece or historical artwork.
