{"id":"168666857","responseA":"This is an image of a wine bottle with the label "cloudfall". The label features an illustration, predominantly of what appears to be a landscape with clouds and possibly mountainous terrain. There don't appear to be any distinct animals or humans on the label; it seems more focused on the natural landscape. On a scale of 0 (not certain at all) to 1 (very certain), I am about 0.95 certain there are no animals or humans visible in the illustration, based on this image. The small size and style of the illustration make it difficult to be absolutely certain without a closer examination.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.95}"}
