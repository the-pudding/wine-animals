{"id":"147918734","responseA":"The label on the wine bottle features artistic line drawings that seem to depict figures that may be interpreted as humans or possibly animals due to their abstract and ornate design.

As for the certainty score, I'll provide a score of 0.5 due to the ambiguity of the figures on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "ambiguous figures", "certainty": 0.5}"}
