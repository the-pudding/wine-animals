{"id":"172105476","responseA":"The wine label displays what appears to be an illustration of a chess piece, specifically a king, within a circular border. There are no real animals or humans present, but the chess piece may bear some resemblance to a human form as part of its design. My certainty regarding this observation is 1, as I am very certain of my assessment of the image.If you're referring to whether I can see any actual animals or humans on the label besides the chess piece illustration, my answer would be no, there are no real animals or humans on the label. My certainty level remains at 1 for this as well.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
