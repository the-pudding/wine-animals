{"id":"167212246","responseA":"I cannot see the entire label clearly due to the angle and the focus of the image, which makes it difficult to discern small details. However, based on what is visible, there do not appear to be any animals or humans depicted on the portion of the wine label that we can see. I would say I am 0.9 certain of this, acknowledging that there is a small possibility that other parts of the label not fully visible might contain such imagery.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.9}"}
