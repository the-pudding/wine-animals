{"id":"169337786","responseA":"The wine label features an abstract image that could be interpreted as an animal, possibly a bird, given the shape that might resemble a beak and a head. However, the abstraction does not allow for a certain classification, and it could be a purely abstract design without any representational intent. Based on the image, I am fairly certain there is an animal depicted, so I would rate the certainty as 0.8 on the scale provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 0.8}"}
