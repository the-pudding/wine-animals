{"id":"173226164","responseA":"The image features a wine label with an abstract artistic design that might suggest the image of a person in a very stylized form. It is not a realistic depiction of a human, and the interpretation of the image as a person might be subjective due to its abstract nature. On a scale from 0 to 1 in terms of certainty, if there indeed is a suggested human form, I would say the certainty is about 0.5, because it's an artistic representation and not a clear, definite depiction of a person.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 0.5}"}
