However, to provide an actual output, the text that describes the wine label needs to be provided. Example:```json{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}```The 'animal' key would have the name of the animal or human, if one was described in the wine label text. The 'certainty' key would contain a number between 0-1 which represents my certainty in this information."}
