{"id":"171237263","responseA":"Yes, there appears to be a stylized representation of a human on the wine label. This is evident in the central graphic, which depicts what looks like a simplified or abstract figure with limbs outstretched and a circular shape for a head, possibly engaging in some activity or dance. I am very certain of this observation; on the scale provided, I would say 1. It's important to note that this is an artistic depiction and not a photograph or image of a real person.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
