{"id":"157434443","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with the name "Ada Nada" featured prominently at the top. Below the name, there is the designation "BARBARESCO", followed by "DENOMINAZIONE DI ORIGINE CONTROLLATA E GARANTITA" and the specific name "VALEIRANO". Additionally, there is a small graphic of a bird within a blue square towards the bottom middle of the label. Based on these elements, I am very certain (1) that there is an animal depicted on the label; it is a stylized image of a bird. There are no human figures on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
