{"id":"164163903","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "SARACCO." Below the brand name, it is indicated that the wine is a Pinot Nero from the Piedmont (Piemonte) region of Italy, and it holds a protected designation of origin status. The label also includes information about the bottling location and producer.Regarding the presence of animals or humans, the upper part of the label features artwork of some sort, but it is not entirely clear what the image depicts due to the abstract nature of the design. No discernible animals or humans can be confirmed from this image. I would rate my certainty regarding the absence of clear images of animals or humans as 1, because it does appear to be an abstract or stylized pattern rather than a representation of any living beings.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
