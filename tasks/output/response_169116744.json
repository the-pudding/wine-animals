{"id":"169116744","responseA":"I do not see any clear distinct animals or humans on the label of the wine bottle you've presented. The design seems to be abstract or stylized, with elements reminiscent of vine leaves or grapes, which is common for wine labels as it refers to the product's origin. There are some forms that could be perceived as figures or part of the landscape, but they are not clearly defined as humans or animals. My certainty level is 1, as I'm relying on visual analysis of the content of the image presented.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
