{"id":"166497556","responseA":"Yes, there is a depicted human figure on the wine label. The figure is standing on top of what appears to be a representation of a wine glass, which creatively uses the imagery of roots or vines to illustrate the glass stem and base. Based on the context, I am very certain this is an artistic representation intended for the wine label design, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1. There are no animals visibly present in this image.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 1}"}
