{"id":"173062969","responseA":"Yes, the wine label features an illustration that includes a human figure. The figure appears to be a woman sitting down, viewed from behind. She's wearing a hat with a flower design and a yellow dress with floral patterns. She seems to be outside, as there are elements that resemble plants or cacti around her. I'm very certain about the presence of a human figure in the illustration, so on a scale of 0 to 1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
