{"id":"165688933","responseA":"The image is of a bottle of wine with a label reading "Napa Valley Chardonnay Darioush." On the label, there appears to be an embossed or printed emblem featuring what might be a stylized lion or some similar creature facing to the side, reminiscent of ancient Persian art. I am very certain that there is an animal depicted on this label; my certainty level would be 1. There are no real animals or humans, just the emblem which represents an animal.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
