{"id":"172836908","responseA":"The label features drawings that appear to be a mix of human-like figures and possibly an animal-like figure, specifically a pig. The figures seem to be engaged in playful, whimsical activities, which include dancing and playing instruments. My certainty level regarding the presence of human-like and animal-like figures on this wine label is 1, as the art style clearly depicts these kinds of figures, although they are rendered in an abstract and stylized manner.","responseB":"{"animal": "human, pig","certainty": 1}"}
