{"id":"156276181","responseA":"The image shows a label of Barolo wine from the producer "Cascina Bongiovanni." The label features what appears to be an abstract silhouette of a bird in flight.

I am very certain of my observation, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "bird",  "certainty": 1}"}
