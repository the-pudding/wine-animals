It features the name of the winery, "Stafford Hill," as well as "Holloran," which likely signifies a connection with the producer or vineyard name. It is a 2021 Sauvignon Blanc from Willamette Valley, Oregon, and the alcohol content is stated as 14.3% by volume. There's a monogram logo that includes the letters "HVW," but no depictions of animals or humans are present. I'm very certain about this; on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
