{"id":"170514726","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that features a stylized illustration of a human figure. The figure appears to be a person performing a gymnastic move, specifically a handstand, on top of what seems to be a representation of bull's horns, which likely symbolizes some cultural or regional significance related to the wine's origin. There are no animals depicted in this image. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
