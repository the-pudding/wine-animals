{"id":"171975188","responseA":"In the image, you can see a wine label with the text "Les Hauts de Smith" and a very small illustration of a coat of arms. The coat of arms features what appears to be a crescent moon and three fleur-de-lis symbols. This is a heraldic design and there are no discernible animals or humans depicted. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
