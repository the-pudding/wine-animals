{"id":"167408213","responseA":"The image is of a wine bottle with a label that reads "CLOS ROMANILE - Saint-Emilion Grand Cru, 2014". The label features a graphic that appears to be a stylized depiction of a leaf or an artistic symbol, rather than an animal or human figure. There is no clear presence of animals or humans on the label itself. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.In the background, there is a person seated at a table, but they are not the focus of this image and are partially obscured.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
