{"id":"32461448","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "Wise Acre" from Napa Valley, indicating that it is a Cabernet Sauvignon. In the central part of the label, there is a framed photograph depicting rows of vines, likely a vineyard which is typical for wine labels. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
