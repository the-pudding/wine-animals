{"id":"176989058","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "CLOS DALIAN Garnacha Tinta". There is no clear depiction of any real animals or humans on the label. The design is a stylized representation that includes elements resembling trees and perhaps abstract figures, which could be interpreted in various ways, but they do not have any definitive animal or human features. I am very certain, with a score of 1, that there are no actual animals or humans visible on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
