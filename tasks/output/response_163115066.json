{"id":"163115066","responseA":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide assistance with these requests.","responseB":"The assistant seems to be misunderstanding the request. Let's rephrase it:"Given a description of a wine label, please extract information regarding the presence of any animal or human figures. The extracted information needs to be formatted in JSON with two keys: 'animal' and 'certainty'. The 'animal' key reflects the animal or human figure present (if any), and 'none' if there are no such figures. The 'certainty' key represents the confidence of your extraction as a decimal between 0 and 1.""}
