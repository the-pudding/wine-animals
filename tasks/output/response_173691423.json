{"id":"173691423","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the words "SCATTERED PEAKS" prominently displayed. There's an illustration which appears to be of a mountainous landscape or waves, and below it, the text indicates the type of wine as "fum√© blanc - napa valley, california." There is a small logo or signature at the bottom right that reads "DEREK BENHAM." There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; the artwork is abstract and does not portray living beings. I am certain at a level of 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
