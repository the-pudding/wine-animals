{"id":"170069125","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. It is a text-based label that appears to be for a wine named "Savigny-Les-Beaune," specifically the "Cuv√©e Reine Joly" by "Camus-Bruchon & Fils." The label includes information common to wine bottles such as the type of wine, the appellation, the producers, and the volume, in this case, 750ml. I am very certain (1 on your scale) that there is no depiction of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
