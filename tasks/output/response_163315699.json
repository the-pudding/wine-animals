{"id":"163315699","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features an abstract design with a blue-green watercolor background and stylized text that reads "Manzanilla Velo Flor." There's a small icon above the text that appears to be a stylized graphic, possibly related to the winery's branding or the type of wineâ€”however, it doesn't represent an animal or human. I am very certain of this, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
