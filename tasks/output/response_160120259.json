{"id":"160120259","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from "Marimar Estate," specifically for a Chardonnay from "Don Miguel Vineyard" in the "Russian River Valley." At the top of the label, there is a stylized logo or emblem that could be interpreted as an abstract figure, but it does not explicitly depict an animal or a human. Given the context and the stylization of the graphic, I am very certain (1) that there is no realistic depiction of an animal or human on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
