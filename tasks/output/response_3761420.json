{"id":"3761420","responseA":"There appears to be an emblem or crest at the top part of the wine label, which might contain an animal as it's a common feature in heraldic crests. However, due to the angle and the focus of the image, the details within the crest are not clearly discernible, so I cannot confirm with certainty whether there is an animal or human depicted on it or not. My certainty level regarding the presence of an animal or human within the emblem would be low, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is closer to 0.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0}"}
