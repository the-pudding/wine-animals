{"id":"171450264","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Côte-Rôtie," which is an appellation for a French wine from the northern Rhône wine region. The label also indicates that it is a wine from 1993, and there is a mention of R. & V. Levet, which suggests the name of the producer. From what is visible, there are no animals or humans depicted on the label; the label features text and appears to have a graphic that resembles a landscape or vineyard scene. I am certain (1/1) that there are no clear images of animals or humans on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
