{"id":"173236970","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru - Les Cailles" and "Domaine C*****". The label features a coat of arms that includes an animal, which appears to be a lion, a symbol often used in heraldry. I am very certain (1) that it is a lion depicted on the label based on the design and common use of such symbols on wine labels and crests. There are no humans visible on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
