{"id":"175279233","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with a heraldic-style emblem. There appears to be a representation of an animal - specifically a griffin, which is a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. There are no humans visible on the label. On a scale of 0-1 regarding certainty, I am at 1, as the image is clear and the details of the label are easily discernible.","responseB":"{"animal": "griffin","certainty": 1}"}
