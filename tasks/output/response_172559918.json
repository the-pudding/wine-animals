{"id":"172559918","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It prominently features the brand name "FORREST" with the type of wine "SAUVIGNON BLANC" indicated below it, and specifies the region "Marlborough" and "New Zealand Wine". The design is simple without any depictions of animals or humans. My certainty level is 1, as the label is clear of any such imagery.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
