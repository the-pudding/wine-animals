{"id":"171311998","responseA":"The image depicts a wine bottle with a label that features drawings. Looking closely at the illustrations, I can observe what appears to be some tiny figures that could be interpreted as people on boats and possibly tiny animal figures on or around the boats. However, these illustrations are quite stylized and small, making it difficult to determine with absolute certainty without a closer inspection. Given that the figures are artistic representations and not photographs, their level of detail is limited. My certainty level that the label depicts humans or animals would be around 0.5 due to the interpretive nature of the artwork.","responseB":"{"animal": "humans, animals", "certainty": 0.5}"}
