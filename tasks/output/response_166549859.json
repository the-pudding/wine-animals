{"id":"166549859","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to be an artistic and stylized representation of a human figure. It is not a real human or animal but a graphic design used for branding the wine. The figure is depicted in an exaggerated, playful manner. I am very certain that there are no real humans or animals depicted on this label, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
