{"id":"161298344","responseA":"The image depicts a stylized human figure on the wine label. It appears to be an artistic representation, possibly evoking themes related to winemaking or the history associated with the wine's brand. I'm certain (1 on the scale) that the graphic represents a human, as it has a clear head, body, and what appears to be limbs, as well as a face with discernible features. There are no animals visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
