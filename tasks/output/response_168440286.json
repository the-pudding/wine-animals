{"id":"168440286","responseA":"I do not detect any animals or humans on the wine label in this image. I am very certain about this (1 on the scale from 0 to 1). The label is predominantly text-based, providing information about the wine such as the grape variety (Albariño), the region of origin (Rías Baixas), alcohol content, and other relevant details. The centerpiece of the label appears to be a reference to a "Tabla de Sumar," which means "addition table" in Spanish, typically used for mathematical reference rather than regarding wine, making it a unique part of the label's design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
