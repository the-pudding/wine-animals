{"id":"170715582","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label in this image. It features the text "PONZI VINEYARDS" prominently at the center with "PINOT NOIR" and "LAURELWOOD DISTRICT" below it. The background is a dark bottle with a textured label. I am very certain there are no animals or humans depicted on this label, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
