{"id":"157368275","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Le Spinaie Brunello di Montalcino 2018". The upper part of the label seems to depict a coat of arms with a crown. Surrounding the coat of arms, there might be some graphics that could resemble flames, but the resolution is not high enough for me to discern any specific animals or humans. My certainty about the lack of visible animals or humans is about 0.9, considering that the focus of the image is on the text and the crest-like figure which typically would not have detailed representations of animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.9}"}
