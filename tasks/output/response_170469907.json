{"id":"170469907","responseA":"Based on the image provided, there are no animals or humans on the wine label. The label is textual, with the brand name "ALTA VISTA," the designation "ESTATE PREMIUM," and the varietal "TORRONTÃ‰S" indicated, along with the region "MENDOZA - ARGENTINA." There is also an image that seems to depict a landscape/vineyard, but there are no discernible animals or humans. My certainty level is 1, meaning I am very certain of my assessment based on the image presented.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
