{"id":"160429930","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from Napa Valley, specifically for "Belle Cousine" red wine from Hyde Vineyard. On the label, there's a shield-like emblem with decorative elements including what appears to be a fleur-de-lis on top. However, there are no animals or humans visible on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
