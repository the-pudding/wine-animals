{"id":"166565921","responseA":"On the wine label, there is an emblem that features a bird with outstretched wings at the top of what appears to be a coat of arms. This emblem is quite stylized and typical for heraldic symbols, but it is indeed representative of an animal (a bird). I am very certain that no human figures are present on the label. My certainty level is 1 for both the absence of human figures and the presence of an animal depiction.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
