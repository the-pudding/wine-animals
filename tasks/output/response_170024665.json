{"id":"170024665","responseA":"The image features a wine label with the text "PASANAU Ceps Nous" prominently displayed at the center. The label also includes an illustration that appears to depict buildings or a small village, possibly a winery or related to the vineyard. There are no clear images of animals or humans on the label. My certainty level that there are no animals or humans depicted on this part of the label is 1, very certain, as the illustration does not include any recognizable human or animal figures based on this view.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
