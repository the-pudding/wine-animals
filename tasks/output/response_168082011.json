{"id":"168082011","responseA":"The image appears to be the label of a wine bottle for "Vin de Savoie Apremont," which is a type of white wine from the Savoie region in France. The label features a picturesque illustration of a rural scene with a house and vegetation, and there's also a coat of arms with a bee at the top. There are no animals or humans discernible in this image of the label. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain of my analysis based on the visible elements in the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
