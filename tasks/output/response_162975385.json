{"id":"162975385","responseA":"I can see the label of a wine bottle that reads "Mezzacorona Pinot Grigio Trentino DOC." There is an image on the label that seems to depict a landscape, possibly of mountains, and two small figures that could represent people. It's not very detailed, but based on the context and common conventions for wine labels, I would say I am about 0.7 certain that these are intended to represent human figures within a landscape, aligning with the aesthetic of the product.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 0.7}"}
