{"id":"160140453","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with the label "Cabriz," indicated as a product of Portugal. The specific wine variety mentioned is "Encruzado" from the DÃ£o wine region. On the label, there's a graphic representation that appears to be a depiction of buildings or a chateau, which is common on wine labels to represent the winery or the wine's origin.I don't see any discernible animals or humans on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on the scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
