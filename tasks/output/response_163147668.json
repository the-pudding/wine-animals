{"id":"163147668","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Catena Chardonnay." The label features a sketch with no clear depiction of any animals or humans. It appears to be an abstract design, possibly representing a landscape with elements like mountains and vines or elements related to wine production. There's nothing in the image that distinctly resembles an animal or human form. I would say with a certainty of 1, there's no clear presence of animals or humans on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
