{"id":"168490676","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label. It features an illustration of a building, which appears to be a chateau, surrounded by vegetation. The text on the label identifies it as a "Grand Vin de Bordeaux" from "Ch√¢teau Marjosse," and mentions "Pierre Lurton." I am very certain that there are no humans or animals in this image, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
