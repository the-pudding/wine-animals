{"id":"170985142","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label for "Taurasi," which is a type of Italian wine with a designation of origin label (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita). The label has the name "SIGILLO ELLENICO" at the top and features a circular emblem with an embossed or printed design, which appears to be a classical or ancient coin reprint, possibly Greek in style given the name "SIGILLO ELLENICO" which implies a Hellenic seal.There are no animals or humans visible on the label. I am certain at a level of 1, as the design elements on the wine label do not include any images of animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
