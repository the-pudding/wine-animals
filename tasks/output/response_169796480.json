{"id":"169796480","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle label that reads "LES RUISSEAUX" and below it is the designation "INDICATION GÉOGRAPHIQUE PROTÉGÉE ARDÈCHE." The label belongs to "DOMAINE Jean-Claude MARSANNE," which is a vineyard located in Mauves (07300), Ardèche, France. The design includes drawings of grape bunches and grapevine leaves, which are typical illustrations for wine labels, indicating what the product is made from. There are no animals or humans depicted on this label; it strictly features botanical illustrations related to vineyards. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans in the image is 1 - I'm very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
