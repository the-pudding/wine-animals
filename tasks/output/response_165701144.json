{"id":"165701144","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Castalia PINOT NOIR." It indicates that the wine is from Russian River Valley, Sonoma County, Rochioli Vineyard, and has an alcohol content of 14.5% by volume. I can confirm that there are no animals or humans visible on this label. I am 1 (very certain) about this, as the label consists solely of text and a marble-like background design.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
