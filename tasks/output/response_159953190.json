{"id":"159953190","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label for a red wine from Rioja. The label reads "Viña Guria Crianza" and indicates that the wine is from a designated region guaranteed for quality (Denominación de Origen Calificada). There is also a mention of the volume, which is 750ml, and the alcohol content, 13.5% by volume. I do not see any images of animals or humans on the label. I am very certain about this, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
