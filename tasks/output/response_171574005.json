{"id":"171574005","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request.","responseB":"Apologies for the misunderstanding, but there wasn't any text provided. That said, here's how to format your request in JSON:For example, the text describing the wine label states there's a picture of a deer on the label:```{  "animal": "deer",  "certainty": 1}``` Suppose there's no animal or human on the label, it would look like:```{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}``` The certainty indicator is to measure how certain you are about your claim that the animal or lack thereof is depicted on the label. If you're unsure, you can denote that with a lower certainty indicator."}
