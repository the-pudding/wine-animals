{"id":"169030629","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on this wine label. The label displays the name "Frank John," a vintage year "2017," and a description of the wine type "Riesling Brut." A graphic representation of grapes is visible, which appropriately signifies the contents as a wine made from grapes. I am certain this is the correct interpretation of the label, so on a scale of 0-1 with 1 being very certain, I am at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
