{"id":"160064250","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features text, which includes the name of the wine or brand "Henri Champliau" and the type "BLANC DE BLANCS" along with some other details like the word "BRUT," a star symbol, and the country "France." There appears to be an emblem or logo above the name "Henri Champliau." My certainty level that no animals or humans are depicted on this label is 1, as the image is clear and provides a good view of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
