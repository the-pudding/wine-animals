{"id":"172159625","responseA":"I see an image that appears to be a wine label with the brand name "BARBACÃ€N" and the text "Fracia RISERVA" below an abstract illustration. The illustration does not depict any animals or humans; it is a stylized drawing that appears to be a geometric shape, perhaps a representation of a wine vat or other object related to wine production. I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
