{"id":"5046621","responseA":"The image depicts a wine bottle with a label on it. The main label reads "CHERRYBLOCK" and beneath that "SEBASTIANI," which indicates the brand of the wine, followed by "CABERNET SAUVIGNON SONOMA VALLEY," which states the type of wine and its region of origin. Above the main label, there is a smaller label with a red-colored background featuring an illustration that appears to be a tree. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. My certainty level for this assessment is 1, as I am very certain of what is depicted based on the visual information presented.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
