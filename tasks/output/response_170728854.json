{"id":"170728854","responseA":"I can see that there is an animal depicted on the wine label. It appears to be a stylized bird or fish; however, without a clearer view or additional context, I cannot determine with certainty which it is meant to represent. My certainty level is therefore not absolute; I would say my certainty is around 0.5, as the image is clear but interpretation of stylized artwork can be subjective.","responseB":"{"animal": "stylized bird or fish","certainty": 0.5}"}
