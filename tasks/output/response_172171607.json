{"id":"172171607","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label includes text mentioning the name "Flavia" and "Taill√©," refers to "Frappato Perricone," and mentions that the product is made with organic grapes and is from "Terre Siciliane IGP." There appears to be a crown graphic and a few abstract shapes and blocks of color. I am very certain of these observations, so on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 represents 'very certain,' my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
