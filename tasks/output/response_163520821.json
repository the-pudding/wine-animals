{"id":"163520821","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with an illustration that features a stylized hand that appears to have grapevines or a plant growing from the wrist area, symbolizing perhaps the handcrafted nature of the wine or the connection to the vineyard. There are no real animals or humans in this image, only an artistic representation of a hand. I am very certain about this observation; my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
