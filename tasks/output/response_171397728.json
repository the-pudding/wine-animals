{"id":"171397728","responseA":"The label has a design which appears to include a crest or shield as part of its graphical elements. The crest contains images, and it might have representations of animals or other symbols common in heraldry. However, due to the small size of the crest on the label and the details not being fully clear, I cannot confidently identify specific animals or humans on it. My certainty level is low, closer to 0, because the image doesn't provide enough detail to make a clear determination.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0}"}
