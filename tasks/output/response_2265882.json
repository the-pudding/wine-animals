{"id":"2265882","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The image appears to contain an illustration of a building, likely representing a winery or estate, surrounded by what seems to be a vineyard setting. This would be typical for a wine label, as they often showcase the winery or the environment where the wine originates. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
