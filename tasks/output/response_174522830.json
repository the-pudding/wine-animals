{"id":"174522830","responseA":"This image shows a label from a bottle of wine. The label reads "PFEFFINGEN BLANC DE NOIR" and includes a date "EST. 1622", indicating that the vineyard or brand was established in that year. The top part of the label features a stylized image that appears to be an abstract representation of an animal, most likely a bird, based on the beak and wing-like lines.On the scale of certainty about whether the image contains an animal, I am at 1 – very certain – that the label features a stylized animal depiction. There are no human figures or real animals visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
