{"id":"174643367","responseA":"The image displays what appears to be a drawing of a bird with a branch or red coral-like object in its beak. I cannot say with certainty whether the object is supposed to represent an actual branch or coral, or if it symbolizes something else. I do not see any humans or other animals in the image. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain of what is depicted based on the visible elements of the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
