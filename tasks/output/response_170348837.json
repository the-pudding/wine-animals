{"id":"170348837","responseA":"There is no full depiction of humans or animals on this wine label; however, it does feature a small emblem with an illustration that might suggest a creature with wings â€“ potentially a bird or a mythological creature resembling a bird, such as a griffin. My certainty about the absence of a full human or animal figure on the label is 1 (very certain), but given the small size and stylized nature of the emblem, I cannot provide a definitive identification of the creature.","responseB":"{"animal": "possibly a bird or a griffin", "certainty": 0.5}"}
