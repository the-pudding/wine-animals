{"id":"163668320","responseA":"There are no real animals or humans present on the wine label. The image includes artistic doodles or illustrations of human-like figures that appear to resemble a king and other characters possibly from a royal court. They are drawn in a whimsical and stylized manner typical of decorative art on product packaging. My certainty level is 1, as it is clear these are not real humans or animals, but rather illustrations for the label's design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
