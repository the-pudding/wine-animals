{"id":"164484653","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Braunewell" at the top, followed by "Pinot Noir" below it, and "Rheinhessen" at the bottom, indicating the type of wine and the region it comes from. The label has a minimalistic design with no clear depiction of animals or humans; the design element above the brand name appears to be a stylized symbol rather than a representation of a human or animal. Based on this, I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans visible on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
