{"id":"168932078","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It appears to be a label for Verdichhio di Matelica, which is a type of white wine. The design is quite simple with text and some decorative elements. So on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I am 1 (very certain) there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
