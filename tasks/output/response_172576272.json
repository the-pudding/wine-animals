The label displays the name of the wine "Aperture" and mentions "Sauvignon Blanc" as the type of wine, indicating it is likely a white wine.

The image within the label appears to be that of grapes, which is relevant to the product as grapes are the primary ingredient in wine.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
