{"id":"174237840","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features the word "Bourgogne," which indicates that the wine is from the Burgundy region in France. The design is abstract and artistic with geometric patterns and appears to be quite sophisticated. I am very certain there are no animals or humans depicted here, so on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being 'very certain', I am at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
