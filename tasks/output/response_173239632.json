{"id":"173239632","responseA":"There are no clear images of animals or humans on the wine label. The label features abstract shapes and what appears to be smudges or splashes of pinkish-red paint on a peach background.

My certainty level about this observation would be 1, as the shapes do not resolve into recognizable animals or humans.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
