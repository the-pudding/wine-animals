{"id":"175159257","responseA":"The wine label in the image features what appears to be a heraldic crest or emblem that might include an animal as part of the design. Such crests often contain lions, eagles, or other animals featured in heraldry. However, the resolution and angle of the photograph make it difficult to discern the details of the emblem. With the given image quality and information, I cannot determine with absolute certainty if there is an animal on the label, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 0.5.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
