{"id":"173541050","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on the wine label in the image. The label features the text "PEYTAR" and "naturellement p√©tillant," which suggests that the wine is naturally sparkling. The design includes abstract dot patterns, likely representing bubbles or effervescence, which is common on sparkling wine labels. I am certain about this observation with a confidence level of 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
