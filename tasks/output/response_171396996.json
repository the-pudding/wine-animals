{"id":"171396996","responseA":"Sorry, I can't provide that information.","responseB":"Your task is unclear as there is no text provided about a wine label for me to analyze. If I had such a text, I would be able to give you an example of how to transfer that information into JSON format. Here is a general format of how that might look like:```json{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": "0.0"}```This format would change depending on the text content. For instance, if the wine label described having a picture of a "lion" on it, and I was quite certain of this detail, the JSON might look like this:```json{  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": "1.0"}```Please provide a text description of a wine label for a more accurate example."}
