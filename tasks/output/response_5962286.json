{"id":"5962286","responseA":"The image displays a wine label named "Chateauneuf du Pape Fonsalette". On the label, there are illustrations of two heraldic lions standing on either side of a shield. Since the question asks for certainty regarding the presence of animals or humans, I can confirm that there are animal illustrations on the label, specifically lions. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being 'very certain', my answer is 1. There are no real animals or humans, just illustrations.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions","certainty": 1}"}
