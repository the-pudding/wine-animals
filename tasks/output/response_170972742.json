{"id":"170972742","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle label named "Bianco di Ampeleia." There is an abstract line illustration on the label, but it does not clearly depict any animals or humans. The design is primarily geometric and seems to feature shapes suggestive of wine glasses or bottles. I am very certain that there are no distinguishable animals or humans on this label, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
