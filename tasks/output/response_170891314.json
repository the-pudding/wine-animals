{"id":"170891314","responseA":"Based on the image provided, I can see that the label reads "La Poussie SANCERRE Appellation Sancerre Contrôlée" and mentions "Product of France." The image on the label appears to be a black and white photograph or drawing of a landscape, presumably where the wine's grapes are grown. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label—it solely features what looks to be vineyard terraces. I am very certain about my observations, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
