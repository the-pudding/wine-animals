{"id":"159501625","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for Ch√¢teau du Grand Soussans, a Grand Vin de Bordeaux from the Margaux appellation. The label features an illustration of a chateau or estate, which is typical imagery for a wine of this type to reflect its origin and perhaps its prestige. There are no visible animals or humans on the label. My certainty level that there are no animals or humans in this particular section of the image is 1, very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
