{"id":"169887741","responseA":"The image shows a wine label called 'La Porte du Ciel' from the wine region 'La Clape Languedoc', which is noted as an appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) indicating a protected designation of origin for wines from this area. The label features an illustration of what appears to be a chateau or estate surrounded by vineyards, with a rocky outcrop or cliff in the background. There do not appear to be any animals or humans depicted in the illustration on the label. I am very certain about my observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
