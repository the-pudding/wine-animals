{"id":"175007056","responseA":"There appears to be a small depiction of an animal on the wine label, which looks like a deer or similar four-legged creature, stylized and in an artistic rendition. I am fairly certain about the presence of an animal on the label, with a confidence level around 0.8 to 0.9 on a scale of 0 to 1. The certainty is not absolute as art styles may vary and interpretations can be subjective.","responseB":"{"animal": "deer", "certainty": 0.85}"}
