There are three characters depicted, which seem to be drawn in a whimsical or artistic style, typical of some wine labels that aim to be eye-catching or unique. As for certainty, without any contextual knowledge about the specific brand or label, I would rate my certainty as 1 for the presence of human illustrations, as it seems quite clear from the image provided.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 1}"}
