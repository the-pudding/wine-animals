{"id":"174901061","responseA":"The label features an illustration of a human. The depicted person appears to be picking or processing grapes, which is appropriate for a wine label, symbolizing the origins of the wine from the vineyard. I am very certain about the presence of a human illustration on this label, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say my certainty is 1. There are no animals visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
