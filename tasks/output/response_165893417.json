{"id":"165893417","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. It appears to be a label for a wine called "Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot" by "Domaine Bachey-Legros." It indicates that the grapes come from "Les Petits Clos Vieilles Vignes" and identifies the wine as a "Grand Vin de Bourgogne," which means it is a great wine from Burgundy. I am very certain there are no animals or humans on this label (1 being very certain).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
