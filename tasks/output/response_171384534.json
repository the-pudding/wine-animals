{"id":"171384534","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with a coat of arms design. Within the coat of arms, there appear to be some emblematic figures which could be interpreted as animals or mythological creatures, which are common in heraldry. These figures are not real animals or humans; they are artistic representations or symbols typically used in such contexts. As for my certainty, given the stylized nature of heraldic art, I would say I am moderately certain about the presence of animal representations, so around 0.7 on a scale from 0 to 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "heraldry animal figures","certainty": 0.7}"}
