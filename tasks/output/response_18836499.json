{"id":"18836499","responseA":"The image shows the label of a wine bottle, specifically a Gevrey-Chambertin from the Burgundy region in France. The label has a sophisticated design that includes a coat of arms with a shield that has a design of a cross with what appear to be lions in the quadrants, and it has an ornate wreath-like decoration around it. There are also some intricate patterns that resemble foliage around the coat of arms.I do not see any real animals or humans on this label. The elements that might be considered animals are part of the heraldic design on the coat of arms, which are stylized and symbolic rather than depictions of actual animals. Based on the image, I am very certain of this assessment, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
