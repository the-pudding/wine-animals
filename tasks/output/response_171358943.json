{"id":"171358943","responseA":"I can confirm that the image contains the label of a wine bottle, specifically a Pinot Noir from the Monte Degli Angeli in Piemonte. The label features an intricate crest or emblem which is common on wine labels, connoting heritage or branding. There is a depiction of what appears to be an angel or a figure with wings, which is coherent with the name "Monte Degli Angeli" suggesting a connection to "angels."As for animals or humans, the figure in the crest could be interpreted as a human-like figure due to the presence of wings resembling those often attributed to angels in various forms of iconography. On the scale of certainty regarding the presence of a human or animal depiction, I would rate it close to 1, because the emblem clearly illustrates an angelic figure, which falls within the category of human-like images.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
