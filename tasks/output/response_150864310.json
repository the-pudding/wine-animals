{"id":"150864310","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features the brand name "INTIPALKA", the description "VALLE DEL SOL", the type of wine which is "MALBEC", and the volume "750ml" along with an image of what seems to be a sun symbol above the text. It also notes "VALLE DE ICA, PERU" indicating the geographic origin of the wine. I am very certain, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
