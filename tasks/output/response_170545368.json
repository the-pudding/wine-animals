{"id":"170545368","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on this wine label. The label is for "MATUA Sauvignon Blanc Marlborough" from New Zealand. The only graphic is an emblem or symbol at the top of the label, which appears to have a stylized bird or fern design that is a common motif in Maori or New Zealand iconography. I am very certain about this (1 on the scale) as the label primarily contains text and a simple graphic design without any detailed images of animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
