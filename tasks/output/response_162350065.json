{"id":"162350065","responseA":"In the image you've provided, there appears to be an illustration of human figures as part of the design of the wine label. The figures look like they might be engaged in some form of activity, possibly artistic like playing musical instruments or conducting some kind of work that relates to alchemy, as indicated by the name on the label. There are no clear depictions of animals visible on the label.As for certainty, my level of confidence regarding the presence of illustrated human figures on the label would be 1, or 'very certain.' There are distinct outlines and shapes that suggest human forms. However, without more of the label visible or additional context, the exact nature of the activity they are engaged in or further details about them cannot be determined.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
