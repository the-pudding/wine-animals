{"id":"171395596","responseA":"On the label, there appears to be an emblem or crest that includes a stylized graphic, which could be interpreted as decorations or symbols rather than actual depictions of animals or humans. It's not clear enough to confirm whether these are intended to represent real animals or humans or are merely decorative elements. I would rate my certainty as a 0.5 out of 1, given the stylized and ambiguous nature of the graphics on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
