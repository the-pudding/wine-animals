{"id":"150348274","responseA":"There are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The label features an illustrated scene with a building that appears to be a villa or estate, surrounded by an ornamental design with elements that look like mythological creatures or figures, which are often found on such decorative labels. However, they do not represent real animals or humans. I'm very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
