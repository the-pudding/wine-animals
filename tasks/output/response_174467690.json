{"id":"174467690","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Chateau Mont-Redon Côtes du Rhône". There is an emblem which might resemble a crest or a coat of arms in the center of the label, typically used for branding or to indicate the winery's heritage. However, this emblem is quite small and detailed, making it difficult to discern any specific elements such as animals or humans from here.Based on the image provided and with the understanding that emblems or crests can sometimes include figures such as animals or humans, I would say that there is not a clear, distinguishable image of an animal or human on the label. Given the size and complexity of the emblem and without a closer view or higher resolution image, my certainty about the absence of animals or humans on the label is approximately 0.75. There appears to be no obvious depiction of entire creatures; it's more of a graphical representation emblematic of the vineyard or wine's brand identity.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.75}"}
