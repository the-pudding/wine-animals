{"id":"169929845","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. I can see the text "Kings Ridge," "Oregon Pinot Gris," "Willamette Valley Grown," as well as the alcohol content and volume information. There is a geometric design, but no depictions of animals or humans. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
