{"id":"172176847","responseA":"The image displays a wine label that reads "RUSSIZ SUPERIORE" at the top and includes additional information about the wine below. There is a graphic in gold color, which appears to be a crest or emblem featuring a lion and some vegetal elements. So yes, there is an animal depicted on the label, which is a stylized lion as part of the emblem. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as a 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
