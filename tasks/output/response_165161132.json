{"id":"165161132","responseA":"Yes, there appears to be an image of a person on the wine label. The figure is illustrated in an artistic style and seems to be a woman depicted wearing a blue dress and holding what looks like a glass. I am quite certain this is an illustration of a humanâ€”it's a stylized representation, but the features are clearly meant to depict a person. My certainty would be at a 1, as the intention of the artist seems clear to represent a human figure.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 1}"}
