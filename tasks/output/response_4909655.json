The label displays the name "Pierre Chainier" along with the word "Seduction" and "Brut" indicating the type of wine. The only illustration is of a vintage car, which doesn't qualify as an animal or human. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain there are no images of humans or animals on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
