{"id":"170919164","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on the wine label in the image. The label features the name "CASS," indicates that it is "Estate Grown" and from "Paso Robles," and it mentions the variety "Marsanne." The graphical representation appears to be that of a building, likely related to the winery itself. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
