{"id":"154471478","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features a scenic landscape with what appears to be vineyards, a house, trees, and hills in the background. There is also text on the label which reads, "Belle Pente," "Estate Reserve," "Pinot Noir," and "Yamhill-Carlton." My certainty level is 1, meaning I am very certain that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
