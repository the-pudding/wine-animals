{"id":"170439286","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on the wine label in the image. The label features the brand name "BARISTA" and indicates that the wine is made from the Pinotage variety originating from South Africa. There is also a graphic element resembling a stylized crest or emblem above the word "Pinotage." My certainty level that there are no humans or animals on the label is 1, as the content is limited to text and simple graphic design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
