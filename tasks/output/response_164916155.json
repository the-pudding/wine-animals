{"id":"164916155","responseA":"In the image, there is no depiction of any real animals or humans. The illustration appears to feature a fantastical submarine with what seems to be tentacles wrapped around it, which could be an artistic depiction of a sea creature, likely inspired by works of fiction like Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." I am very certain (1) that there are no real animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
