{"id":"156320484","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't provide assistance with that request.","responseB":"As an AI model with language processing feature, I can't literally see an image like humans do and therefore my ability to extract details from wine label images is non-existent. I could only provide the details based on the text provided and in this case, there is no text provided at all. Thus, I can't provide details about the presence of any animal or human character on the label as well as the certainty. Here's a default output:```json{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 0}```"}
