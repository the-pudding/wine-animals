{"id":"168886134","responseA":"The image shows a wine label from "Aquilini", specifically a Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Mountain, Washington. At the top of the label, there is a graphic that resembles a bird, possibly an eagle or similar raptor, which symbolizes an animal. I am very certain about my observations—my certainty level would be 1—as the image is clear and the label details are legible. However, there are no humans or other types of animals depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1.0}"}
