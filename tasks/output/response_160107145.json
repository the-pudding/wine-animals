{"id":"160107145","responseA":"In the image, I see a wine bottle with a label. The label reads "matanzas creek winery Chardonnay Sonoma County." There is a decorative element above the text that appears to have a symmetrical design, possibly inspired by vine or plant motifs. I do not see any animals or humans on the label. My certainty level about the absence of animals or humans on this label is 1, meaning I am very certain based on the visible parts of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
