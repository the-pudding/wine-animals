{"id":"2137837","responseA":"The image shows a label on a bottle of "Brut Reserve" wine. The label features a detailed drawing of a classical building fa√ßade, which appears to be a manor or possibly a winery estate. There are no discernible animals or humans included in the design of this label. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans on the label is 1, meaning I am very certain based on what is visible in the image.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
