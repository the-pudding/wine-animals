{"id":"162217198","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label. It features text that appears to indicate the name and type of wine, as well as possibly the winery's logo or emblem. I cannot see the entire emblem clearly, but from what is visible, there are no discernible human or animal figures. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
