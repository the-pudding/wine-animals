{"id":"173991228","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. The label features the brand name "RED CAR," some details about the vineyard location and elevation, as well as the type of wine, which is "Pinot Noir." There's also a mention of "Fort Ross-Seaview," likely indicating the specific region the wine is from. The image on the label appears to be a stylized illustration of a landscape, possibly depicting hills or mountains, but it does not include any discernible animals or humans. I am very certain about this observation; on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
