{"id":"161096017","responseA":"The image depicts a wine bottle with a label that reads "Mt. Monster Shiraz" from the Limestone Coast of Australia. There are no animals or humans on the label. The design is quite minimalistic, featuring only text and a stylized representation of a mountain, which is part of the brand identity but does not depict an animal or human. I'm very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being very certain, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
