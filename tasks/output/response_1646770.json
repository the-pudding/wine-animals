{"id":"1646770","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the text "Vinsanto del Chianti Classico" indicating it is a Vin Santo wine from the Chianti Classico region, and "Fontodi" is likely the name of the winery. The label has a decorative element that includes a vine or a plant, and there's an illustration of a grape leaf. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. I am very certain about this evaluation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
