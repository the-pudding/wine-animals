{"id":"167132411","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label. It features the text "CLEAN SLATE" at the top, followed by "RIESLING" and then a mention of "Mosel, Germany," a region known for its steep slate hills and winding rivers. The design on the label looks like an artistic representation of slate rocks, which is fitting given the name of the brand and the description of the region where the wine comes from. I am very certain about this observation â€“ my confidence level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
