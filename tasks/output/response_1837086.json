{"id":"1837086","responseA":"There is a stylized image that could represent a dog due to the name of the wine "the howling dog". It appears to be an abstract or minimalist design of a dog. On a scale from 0 to 1 regarding certainty, I would say I'm 0.8 sure there's a representation of an animal (specifically a dog) on the label because the visual is quite minimalistic and could be open to interpretation, but the context provided by the text suggests it is meant to be a dog.","responseB":"{"animal": "dog","certainty": 0.8}"}
