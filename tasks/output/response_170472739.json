{"id":"170472739","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from "Domaine La Prut" which is a vin de Moldova, indicating that the wine is from Moldova. The variety of wine is "Sauvignon Blanc" which is characterized as a "Vin de Calitate" or quality wine, and it's described as "Alb Sec", meaning it is a dry white wine. The label features an illustration of a vineyard landscape. There are no images of humans or animals in the illustration â€“ it portrays rows of vines, possibly representing a vineyard, in a stylized form. There are some graphical elements and text on the label but again, no discernible animals or humans. I am very certain about this, so on the scale, my certainty would be a 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
