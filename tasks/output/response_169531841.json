{"id":"169531841","responseA":"I see representations of humans on the label, specifically there are cartoonish or illustrated figures with box-like heads that appear to be human. These are not real humans but rather artistic depictions or symbols meant to represent humans on the wine label. There are no actual animals or real humans visible in this image. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain of the content depicted in this image based on its visual characteristics.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
