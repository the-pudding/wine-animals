{"id":"171373423","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label reading "DOMAINE DES CLOSIERS." The label features a simple design with text and a small coat of arms or crest at the top right-hand side. The crest includes what appears to be a shield with elements inside. I do not see any animals or humans on this label. There might be graphical elements or stylized images within the crest, but they are too small and indistinct to make out any specific details. I am very certain that there are no clear images of animals or humans on the main visible parts of the label. My certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
