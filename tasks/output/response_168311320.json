{"id":"168311320","responseA":"The label on the wine bottle has a depiction of two birds, which appear to be placed on a geometric background that could represent land or water, given the horizontal lines and color scheme. It's a stylized illustration rather than a realistic image. I am very certain about there being animals depicted on the labelâ€”on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1. There are no human figures or any real animals in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "birds", "certainty": 1 }"}
