{"id":"170495195","responseA":"I do not detect any animals or humans on this wine label. It features abstract lines that may represent terrain or topographical lines, along with text indicating the wine type, vintage ('MALBEC 2019'), and the brand name. There are symbols that might be intended to represent compass directions (such as 'N' for North), but no discernible images of animals or humans. I am very certain of this assessment, so I would rate it as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
