{"id":"171865889","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Morgon," which is a type of wine from a controlled designation of origin known as Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in the Beaujolais region of France. The label features an illustration of a building, likely a representation of the wine estate or chateau where the wine is produced. Above the illustration, there's a coat of arms that includes a heraldic lion. However, there are no real animals or humans visible on the label. My certainty level regarding this description is 1, as I am relying on the visual evidence presented in the image and my understanding of wine labeling practices.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
