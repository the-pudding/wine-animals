{"id":"2809502","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of Crémant d'Alsace, labeled Dopff & Irion Rosé Brut. From what is visible, there are no animals or humans on the label. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans in this part of the image is 1 – very certain. However, it is worth noting that I can only analyze the visible portion of the label, and without a full view of the label, there is a small possibility of an animal or human figure being present in a part that is not shown.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
