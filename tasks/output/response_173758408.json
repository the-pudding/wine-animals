{"id":"173758408","responseA":"The image on the wine label depicts what appears to be human figures, engaged in some type of activity, possibly related to wine production or agriculture. The artwork is stylized and abstracted, so the figures are not distinctly detailed but give the impression of people. I am certain, with a confidence level of 1, that these are intended to represent humans as part of the label's artistic design. There are no clear depictions of animals in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
