{"id":"170224665","responseA":"In the image, there is no clear depiction of any animals or humans on the wine label. The label features text that includes "Corte Corsano," "Governo all'uso Toscano," and "TOSCANA Indicazione Geografica Tipica 2017 PRODUCT OF ITALY." There is a crest or emblem at the top, but it does not clearly represent an animal or human. Based on what I can see, I would say with near certainty, a rating of 1, that there are no animals or humans depicted on this visible portion of the wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
