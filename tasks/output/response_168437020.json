{"id":"168437020","responseA":"The image features a wine bottle label that includes some artwork. Among the drawn elements, there appears to be a small depiction of a bird on the lower right area of the label, perched on one of the green branches. The artwork likely represents a vine or grape leaves associated with wine, and the bird adds an artistic touch to the design. I am very certain that this is a bird depicted on the label; my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
