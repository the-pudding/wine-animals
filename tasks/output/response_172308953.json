{"id":"172308953","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the word "PURE" at the top and "JONC BLANC" at the bottom. The artwork on the label features a stylized pattern that could be interpreted as an abstract design or an arrangement of stones. There are no discernible animals or humans depicted on this label. My certainty level that there are no animals or humans depicted is 1, as it is very clear that the image contains an inanimate design with no representation of living creatures.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
