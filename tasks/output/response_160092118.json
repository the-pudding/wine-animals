{"id":"160092118","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from "Chateau Monbrison". The label features an ornate crest with what appears to be a stylized lion and a crown, which are common elements in heraldry, surrounded by decorative motifs. There are no actual animals or humans present; these are artistic representations that are part of the crest or emblem on the label. I am 1 - very certain about my observation.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion","certainty": 1}"}
