{"id":"142831785","responseA":"The image is indeed of a wine label, and it appears to feature an artistic representation of a landscape, likely referencing the region where the wine originates. There are buildings that resemble houses or churches typical of a quaint European village scene. I do not see any clear depictions of animals or humans in this part of the label. Based on the visible elements, I am very certain of my observation, so I would rate my certainty as 1. Please note that if there are any subtle or stylized representations of humans or animals that are not apparent from this perspective or are part of the artistic landscape rendition, they are not distinctly observable in the section of the label shown.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
