{"id":"173798704","responseA":"On the wine label, there is an illustration depicting a human figure riding a horse. The human appears to be a knight holding a shield and a flag, and both the rider and horse are stylized and represented in a traditional heraldic manner. There are no real animals or humans in the image; it is strictly an artistic depiction. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse, human","certainty": 1}"}
