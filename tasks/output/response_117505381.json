{"id":"117505381","responseA":"This image depicts a wine label that reads "Chateau Taillefer Pomerol". The label features an image of a stately home or chateau that might be associated with the vineyard. As for the presence of animals or humans, there appear to be figures that could potentially be humans in front of the chateau in the picture, but due to the small size and lack of detail, it's not entirely clear. My certainty level about the presence of humans in the image on the wine label is low, I would rate it as a 0.5 on a scale from 0 to 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 0.5}"}
