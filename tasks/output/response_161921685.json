{"id":"161921685","responseA":"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with this request.","responseB":"I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any description of a wine label. Let's say for instance, if you provided a description like "The label is minimalist with a stylized image of a hawk soaring over a vineyard.", the resulting JSON format would look like this:{  "animal": "hawk",  "certainty": 1} Please provide a description of a wine label if you want me to convert it into JSON."}
