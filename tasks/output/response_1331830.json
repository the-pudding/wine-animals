{"id":"1331830","responseA":"The label features an image that appears to be a face with grapevine motifs. The face could be interpreted as human-like, but since it's a stylized representation on a label, it doesn't depict an actual human being. There are no clear images of animals present. My certainty level that the image includes a human-like figure as part of a design is 1, since it's very clear, but it's important to note that it's an artistic rendition rather than a real person.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
