{"id":"168190456","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the brand "Furlani" and text indicating details about the wine, including "ALPINO MACERATO," "Sui lieviti," "Vino Frizzante," and "Spontaneous Fermented In The Bottle." There is a colorful graphic that appears to represent a mountain and sun, but there are no animals or humans depicted on this label. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, I am at 1 for certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
