{"id":"174364783","responseA":"The image on the wine label depicts a pair of human hands. One hand appears to be releasing or tossing a small, origami or paper-crafted figure, which may be interpreted as a bird, while the other hand is open as if ready to catch or gently toss the figure. There are no real animals or human beings in the image, only an illustration of a part of a human. I am very certain (1) that this is an illustration and not an actual human or animal.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
