{"id":"174221936","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with text and a simple line drawing in the center. The drawing resembles a figure in motion, possibly jumping. However, the figure is abstract and could be subject to interpretation; it might suggest a human figure due to its bipedal structure and outstretched limbs. Whether it is intended to represent a human or not is not absolutely clear. There are no clear animal figures present on the label. On the certainty scale, I would rate the presence of a human or animal figure at about 0.5, as the image is not detailed and could be interpreted in various ways.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 0.5}"}
