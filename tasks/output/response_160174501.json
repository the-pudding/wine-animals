{"id":"160174501","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with a coat of arms design. There are animals depicted on it: two lions are facing each other within the shield part of the coat of arms, and above the shield there appears to be a bird, likely an eagle, with its wings spread out. The design is artistic and symbolic, typical of heraldic imagery used in branding to evoke a sense of tradition and quality. I am very certain about this description, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1 for the certainty that there are animals depicted on the wine label. There are no humans visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions, eagle", "certainty": 1}"}
