{"id":"143326753","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Mullan Road Cellars" featuring an illustration of what appears to be a historical scene with mountains and a horse-drawn carriage. There is no clear visibility of animals or humans, as the drawing is stylized and represents a scene rather than focusing on the entities. However, given the context of the artwork, it is reasonable to assume the figures represent humans and horses. I am fairly certain, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 0.8 due to the stylized nature of the illustration which doesnâ€™t clearly depict the details of the figures.","responseB":"{"animal": "humans, horses", "certainty": 0.8}"}
