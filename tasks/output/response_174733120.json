{"id":"174733120","responseA":"I see an image of a wine label for "Holman Ranch Estate Vineyard & Winery." The label is for a 2017 Rosé of Pinot Noir called "Susan's Saignée" from Carmel Valley.

I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
