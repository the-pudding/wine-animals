{"id":"156092985","responseA":"On this wine label, I can identify an illustrated building that appears to be a typical Italian-style facade, which is detailed with windows, a doorway, and architectural accents suggesting a place of some importance or heritage. Above the building, in the night sky, there is a moon and stars, adding to the nocturnal ambiance suggested by the name "Mille e una Notte," which translates to "A Thousand and One Nights" in Italian, invoking connotations of the famous collection of Middle Eastern folk tales also known as "Arabian Nights."There is no clear depiction of an animal or human on the main part of the label depicting the building. However, at the top of the label, there is a small, stylized emblem that appears to be a lion, given its mane and general shape.I am very certain about the presence of the building, the night sky elements, and the emblem. My certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
