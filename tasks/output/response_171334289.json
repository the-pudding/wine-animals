{"id":"171334289","responseA":"Yes, there are human figures on this wine label, depicted as part of what appears to be a mosaic design. They seem to be styled in a classical or ancient motif, often used in wine branding to evoke a sense of tradition or heritage. My certainty level is 1, as the depiction of human figures is clear and intentional in the design of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
