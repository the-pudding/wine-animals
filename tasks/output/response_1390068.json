{"id":"1390068","responseA":"There is an illustration that appears to be a human figure in the center of the wine label. The figure seems to be wearing historical or possibly traditional attire, which could indicate a connection to the heritage of the wine's region or brand identity. Surrounding the central figure are more illustrations that seem to contribute to the historical or traditional theme of the label.I am very certain that the central image represents a human figure; on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1. However, it's important to note that this is not a real human being but rather an artistic representation on the label. There don't appear to be any real animals or humans on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
