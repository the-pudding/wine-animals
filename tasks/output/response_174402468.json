{"id":"174402468","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label mainly displays the brand name "WAGNER VINEYARDS," the type of wine, which is "Ros√© of Cabernet Franc," and it also specifies "Finger Lakes" and "Estate Bottled." The artwork features a landscape with what appears to be a vineyard and some buildings, potentially a representation of the winery itself. There is no clear depiction of animals or humans. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
