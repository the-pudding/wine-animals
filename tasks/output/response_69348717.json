{"id":"69348717","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It prominently displays the name "SAVINO" and indicates that it is a product of Italy and a Prosecco. There is also a coat of arms that features a design, but it does not depict any discernible animals or humans. My certainty level is 1, as the image is clear, and there are no animals or humans visible on the wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
