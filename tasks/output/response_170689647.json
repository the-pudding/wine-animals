{"id":"170689647","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with no visible animals or humans depicted on it. Instead, the label features an illustration of an old-fashioned bicycle or penny-farthing. There's a small bird figure perched on top of the high wheel, which is a stylized representation and not a detailed portrayal of a real bird. My certainty level regarding the absence of actual animals or humans in this image is 1, as the content of the label is quite clear.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
