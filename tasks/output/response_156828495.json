{"id":"156828495","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features a building, presumably a winery or a historic estate, surrounded by what appears to be a vineyard. The text identifies the wine as "BERCEO Crianza" from the Rioja wine region, which is a Denominaci√≥n de Origen Calificada (DOCa) in Spain. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
