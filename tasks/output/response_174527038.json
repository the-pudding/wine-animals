{"id":"174527038","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with no animals or humans depicted on it. The label features the text "Prémices" and "le millésime 2020" along with an illustration of what appears to be a flower or a floral motif. At the top right corner of the label, there is also a symbol that looks like a combination of a compass rose and a wheel. My certainty level that there are no animals or humans on the label is 1 (very certain).","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
