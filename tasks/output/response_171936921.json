{"id":"171936921","responseA":"The image on the wine label features both a human figure and animals. The human figure appears to be a person with wings, resembling an angel or a mythical being, depicted in a traditional or classical illustrative style. There are also birds, which can be identified as animals, shown flying above the water and near the winged figure. I am very certain about the presence of both human figure and animals on this label; therefore, on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "birds", "certainty": 1}"}
