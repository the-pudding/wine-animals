{"id":"160949838","responseA":"The image shows the label of a wine bottle. The label includes text and a coat of arms featuring a design that could be interpreted as animals; it appears to contain two lions facing each other. My certainty regarding the presence of animal images in the coat of arms is 1 (very certain) since the depiction is clear and deliberate, representing a common heraldic symbol. There are no humans visible on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions", "certainty": 1}"}
