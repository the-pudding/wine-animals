{"id":"172854118","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. The label reads "Criss Cross Chardonnay Lodi California", with additional text indicating that it is estate grown and sustainably farmed, and includes the phrase "Intersection of Family and Vineyards". The central feature of the design appears to be a square with a pattern that looks similar to grapevine impressions. There are no discernible figures of animals or humans in the image. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
