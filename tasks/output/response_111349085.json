{"id":"111349085","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Chateau La Cabanne" from the Pomerol region, which is a renowned wine-producing area in Bordeaux, France. The label features an intricate coat of arms with a shield and decorative elements on either side, which resemble griffins (mythical creatures with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle). However, there are no real animals or humans depicted on this label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "griffins","certainty": 1}"}
