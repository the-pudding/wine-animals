{"id":"160251759","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that includes stylized text and design elements. The label displays the letters "EVI" followed by a space and then "VA," and the number "2016" below, which likely indicates the vintage year of the wine. The design consists of leaf or feather-like patterns but does not depict any animals or humans. I am very certain about the absence of any animals or humans on this label, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
