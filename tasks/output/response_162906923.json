{"id":"162906923","responseA":"The image showcases a bottle of wine with a label that reads "Meursault Santenots" and mentions "Domaine Marquis d'Angerville" and "Volnay, CÃ´te-d'Or, France", indicating its origin. There is an emblem or crest on the label that seems to feature a lion, which is a commonly used symbol on heraldic shields or crests. On a scale of 0-1, where 0 is 'not certain at all' and 1 is 'very certain', I am 1, very certain, that there is depiction of an animal, specifically a lion-like figure, on the wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
