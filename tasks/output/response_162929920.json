{"id":"162929920","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that features illustrations of two animals, specifically lions, on either side of a shield with a crown atop it. These animals appear to be supporting the shield in a heraldic fashion, a common motif in coat of arms designs. I am very certain that these are illustrations of animals; on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', my certainty is 1. There are no humans depicted on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions","certainty": 1}"}
