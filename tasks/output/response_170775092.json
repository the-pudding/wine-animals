{"id":"170775092","responseA":"The image shows a label on a wine bottle for "BAYTEN Chardonnay," stated to be made and bottled by a winemaking entity in Constantia Valley, Cape of Good Hope. Regarding the presence of animals or humans, there is a small emblem or crest that includes what appears to be a depiction of a person as part of the design, typically representing a logo or family crest associated with the wine brand. However, it is important to note that the depiction of a person is stylized and forms part of the branding rather than being a photograph of an individual. Regarding certainty, due to the stylized nature of the crest, I would rate my certainty as 1 that the image includes a representation of a human figure as part of the brand emblem, but this is not a depiction of a specific, identifiable person.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
