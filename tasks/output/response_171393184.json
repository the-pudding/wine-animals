{"id":"171393184","responseA":"The wine label in this image does not feature any animals or humans. It is a label for "Passimora," a wine made from Nero d'Avola grapes with a slightly dried grape process, as indicated by "Da uve con leggero appassimento." It is from the Sicilia DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), indicating its region of origin in Sicily, Italy. The label also features the winery "Cantine Pellegrino" founded in 1880. I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans visible on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
