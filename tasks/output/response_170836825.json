{"id":"170836825","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. My certainty level is 1, which means I am very certain of this observation. The label is purely textual with the wine name "TAVEL", the appellation, the year 2018, and the names "Olivier & Lafont." The only graphic element is a star symbol placed between the year and the producer's names.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
