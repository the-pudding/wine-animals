{"id":"174399930","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on this wine label. The label features the name of the winery "Archery Summit," along with the type of wine "Chardonnay" and the specific area "Eola-Amity Hills." The only image is that of a small illustration that resembles a pinecone. My certainty is 1, as the image is clear with high resolution, and the content on the label is easily discernible.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
