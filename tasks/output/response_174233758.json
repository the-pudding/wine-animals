{"id":"174233758","responseA":"Yes, there are both animals and humans depicted on this wine label. The animals appear to be tigers, and in the center, there is an illustrated human figure who seems to be a woman seated with a joyful expression. Surrounding her are various elements and additional human-like figures as part of the artwork, which likely reflect the branding or thematic representation intended by the winemaker. I am very certain of this analysis, so on a scale from 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "tigers, human",  "certainty": 1}"}
