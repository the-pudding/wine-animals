{"id":"151700980","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that reads "BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO" and has the name "LISINI" prominently displayed. The label features two crests with designs; the one on the left has three vertical bars which may symbolize towers or pillars, and the one on the right has a depiction of a rampant lion, which is a common heraldic symbol. There are no images of real humans or animals on the label. On a certainty scale of 0-1, with 1 being 'very certain', I am at 1 that there are no real humans or animals in this image, as the elements are standard graphical representations used in heraldry.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
