{"id":"161383333","responseA":"The label features a stylized graphic that could be interpreted as an abstract representation of an animal, such as a bull, which would be fitting given that "Toro" is the Spanish word for bull and is also a Spanish wine region known for its bold red wines. Given that the image is a stylized depiction and not a clear, realistic image of an animal or human, my certainty is not absolute, but I would assign a confidence level of approximately 0.8 in stating that the graphic represents an animal motif, possibly a bull, in keeping with the theme of the wine's origin.","responseB":"{  "animal": "bull",  "certainty": 0.8}"}
