{"id":"171132141","responseA":"The image appears to be of a wine label featuring childish or naive-style drawings. There are no realistic depictions of animals or humans. The drawings seem to include rudimentary figures that could be interpreted as stick-figure representations of humans, as well as some shapes that might imply the presence of a sun and possibly other abstract or imaginative elements. I am certain (1) that there are drawings on the label, but these are very simple and stylized representations that are open to interpretation.","responseB":"{"animal": "stick-figure representations of humans","certainty": 1}"}
