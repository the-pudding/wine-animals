{"id":"171313118","responseA":"I see an image of a wine label that reads "Sancerre" indicating the type of wine, which is from the Sancerre region known for its white wines made from Sauvignon blanc. The label also reads "Appellation Sancerre Contrôlée", which signifies the wine is from a legally defined area of origin and meets certain standards. Below that is "Domaine Bailly-Reverdy", which is the name of the wine estate, followed by "Vigneron - Récoltant", indicating that the wine is produced by a grower who also harvests the grapes. There are no animals or humans visible on the label. On your scale of certainty, I am 1 (very certain) about the absence of animals or humans in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
