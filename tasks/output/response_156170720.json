{"id":"156170720","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "IOPPA Santa Fe Ghemme." At the top of the label, there is a crest or emblem, which appears to include an animal figure that looks like a lion or a similar feline creature, which is typical for heraldic symbolism. No humans are depicted on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
