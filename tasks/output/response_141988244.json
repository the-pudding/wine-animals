{"id":"141988244","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request.","responseB":"Apologies for the confusion, the assistant needs some text input to proceed. Let's say, for example, your wine label description is as follows:"A colorful label displaying a cluster of grapes in the center. The vineyard's name is delicately entwined within the grapevine. Above it, perched on the vine, is an illustrated rooster in gold leaf. No humans are depicted on the label."The output in json format would look like this:```json{  "animal": "rooster",  "certainty": 1}``` This means there is an animal (rooster) on the label, and I am certain about the identification. If you provide the actual description, I can provide a similar personalized output for you."}
