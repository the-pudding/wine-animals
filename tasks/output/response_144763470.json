{"id":"144763470","responseA":"The image shows an illustration of a coin with various symbols on it, some of which resemble plants or possibly a bird-like figure. However, there is no clear representation of humans or animals in the photograph. Given the context and the stylization of the coin's design, it is not certain whether these figures represent animals or are mere decorative elements. I would assign a certainty level of 0.5 due to the ambiguity in the imagery.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 0.5}"}
