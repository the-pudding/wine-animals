{"id":"169250953","responseA":"There is no clear image of a real animal or human on this wine label. The label features a crest with elements that are ornamental and possibly symbolic in nature, such as a shield and some decorative scrollwork. There is a shape that might resemble a bird as part of the crest design, but it is not a depiction of a real animal; rather, it is a stylized graphic. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
