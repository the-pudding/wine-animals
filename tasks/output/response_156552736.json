{"id":"156552736","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. It is a label designed for a bottle of wine, specifically Amarone della Valpolicella. The design elements consist of text with information about the wine and possibly branding, along with a graphic that appears to be a stylized image related to the wine's brand identity but not depicting animals or humans. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
