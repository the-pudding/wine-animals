{"id":"156117090","responseA":"In the image, there is the label of a wine bottle with the text "Constantia Glen FIVE". At the center of the label, there is an emblem that features what appears to be a heraldic shield with various designs. There are no clear images of animals or humans, but the emblem could contain animal motifs common to heraldry, such as lions or eagles. However, these are not distinctly visible in the detail provided. My certainty level is about 0.8, given that the resolution and angle of the image do not allow for a definitive analysis of the intricate details within the emblem.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.8}"}
