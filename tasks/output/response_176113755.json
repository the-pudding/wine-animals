{"id":"176113755","responseA":"The wine label features an illustration that includes a human figure. The figure appears to be simplified or stylized rather than detailed and is placed inside a boat along with what seems to be produce, possibly grapes given that it is a wine bottle. There are no real animals depicted in the image. My certainty about the presence of a human figure in the illustration on the label is 1 (very certain), understanding that it represents a human and not a real person.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
