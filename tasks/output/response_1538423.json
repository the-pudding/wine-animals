{"id":"1538423","responseA":"I'm sorry, I cannot assist with these requests.","responseB":"As an AI, I'm currently unable to physically analyze items or their labels. If you provided the text description of a wine label, I could assist in extracting the information. For now, here is a template you can use:```json{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1.00}```Please replace "none" with the name of the animal or human, if there is any, in the text description you might provide. Also, adjust the level of certainty based on how clear the description is. For a very vague description, the level of certainty will be low, close to 0. For a very clear and detailed description, the level of certainty will be high, close to 1."}
