{"id":"162283038","responseA":"This wine label features illustrations of animals but no humans. On the label, we can see a depiction of birds, which includes an eagle and an owl prominently displayed, and there may be smaller birds as well. These are stylized artistic renditions of animals typically used for branding and design purposes. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain that these are illustrations of animals and there are no real humans or animals present.","responseB":"{"animal": "birds, eagle, owl","certainty": 1}"}
