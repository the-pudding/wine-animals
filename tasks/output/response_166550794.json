{"id":"166550794","responseA":"The label in the image does not have any animals or humans on it; it's a graphical logo composed of a shield with a crown and what appears to be a cluster of grapes, or a similar emblem, with some decorative elements around it above the text. The logo and text are indicative of a classic wine label design. My certainty level is 1, as I am very sure there are no animals or humans depicted in the small emblem on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
