{"id":"171559573","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with an illustration that appears to incorporate elements of both plants and a human figure. There is a stylized drawing that combines vine or tree branches with a person seemingly in a ballet pose, creating an artistic fusion between the human form and plants. So, while the form suggests a human likeness, it's an artistic representation rather than a depiction of an actual person. I am certain that this is an artistic representation designed for the wine label, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
