{"id":"167771302","responseA":"The image is of a wine bottle label that reads "Chianti Classico" indicating the type of wine, which is from the Chianti region in Italy known for its Sangiovese grapes. The label has a graphic illustration which appears to depict a scenic countryside setting with a building that resembles a traditional Italian villa, surrounded by trees, possibly cypresses, which are common in Tuscany. There are no clear images of animals or humans on this part of the label. I am very certain about this observation (1 on the scale of certainty).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
