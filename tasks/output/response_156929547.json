{"id":"156929547","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. The image shows the label of a wine bottle featuring the name "Côtière" and the text "LEWELLING RANCH VINEYARD Cabernet Sauvignon." The label bears a monochromatic depiction of what appears to be a hilly terrain. I am very certain about this (1 on the scale) as there are no identifiable images of humans or animals on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
