{"id":"171474784","responseA":"The image is a wine label for "Villa Fassini." There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; instead, there is an illustration of a rural landscape that seems to be a vineyard or estate. The label also includes text that indicates the type of wine, its region (Toscana), and the blend of grapes used (Trebbiano - Chardonnay). I am very certain there are no animals or humans on the label, so on a scale of 0-1, I am at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
