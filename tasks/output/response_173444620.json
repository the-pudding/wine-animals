{"id":"173444620","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with no visible animals or humans depicted. Instead, it features text indicating it is a wine from the Bourgogne region, specifically from Chorey-Les-Beaune. Additionally, there is a crest or coat of arms, which is a typical symbol used on wine labels to denote the winery or the family history of the wine producer. In terms of certainty, I would say 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans visible on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
