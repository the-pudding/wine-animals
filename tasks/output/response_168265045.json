{"id":"168265045","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label you've provided. It features the name "HUNKY DORY" prominently with the type of wine "PINOT NOIR" and the region "Marlborough," indicating it's from New Zealand. There's also a simple graphic of a boat on what appears to be water. I am very certain of my observation, so I would rate it a 1 on the certainty scale.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
