{"id":"169668035","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle with a label that reads "CORNAS," which indicates the type of wine and its appellation of origin. The label also includes other text such as "Chaillot," possibly denoting a specific vineyard or location, along with the name "FRANCK BALTHAZAR," which is likely the name of the vintner or producer. There is a graphic design at the top that resembles a cork or a seal, with ornamental patterns around it on both sides. There are no animals or humans visible on the label; it is a text-based design with some decorative elements. I am very certain, in a 1 out of 1 scale, about the observations mentioned as they pertain directly to the content of the image provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
