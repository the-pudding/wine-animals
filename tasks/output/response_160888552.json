{"id":"160888552","responseA":"The image displays a wine label with the text "FOOL HARDY - CABERNET SAUVIGNON - COLUMBIA VALLEY." At the top of the label, there appears to be a tiny, stylized silhouette of a person standing. There are no animals visible on the label. My certainty about the presence of a human representation (the silhouette) on the wine label is 1, as it is clearly depicted, although it is not an actual person but rather a graphic or artistic representation.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
