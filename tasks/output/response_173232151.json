{"id":"173232151","responseA":"The image displays the label of a wine bottle. There is an emblem or crest that features a design with what appears to be a lion and a swan. These are artistic representations and are part of the brand identity or logo for Barton & Guestier. There are no real animals or humans depicted on this label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion, swan", "certainty": 1}"}
