{"id":"162832449","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle with a label that reads "Château La Sauvageonne, Terrasses du Larzac, Grand Vin" and is attributed to Gérard Bertrand, Sud de France. The label features an illustration of what appears to be a building, likely the chateau itself, and surrounding landscape. There are no visible animals or humans on the label. I'm very certain of this observation (1 on the scale of certainty).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
