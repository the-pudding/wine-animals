{"id":"154533579","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Bremerton Tamblyn" that lists the types of grapes used in the wine: Cabernet, Shiraz, Malbec, and Merlot. At the top of the label, there is a silhouette of a human figure standing, potentially suggesting a relaxed and contemplative wine experience. There are no animals visible on the label. I am very certain about these observations, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
