{"id":"174447043","responseA":"The image features a drawing of an anthropomorphic bunch of grapes with a human-like face, arms, and legs. The character appears to be talking or shouting, as indicated by the speech bubble that contains the words "GOT GRAPES". There are no real animals or humans in this image; it is a stylized illustration meant for the wine label. I am very certain about this description, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
