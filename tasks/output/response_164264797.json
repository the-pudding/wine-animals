{"id":"164264797","responseA":"I can see the image depicts a wine bottle with a label that reads "Devils Corner," a Pinot Noir from Tasmania. The artwork on the label features stylized waves with what appears to be abstract representations of figures that could resemble mythological or fantasy characters playing musical instruments. However, there are no clear, realistic depictions of animals or humans on the label. My certainty level regarding the absence of real animals or humans on this label is 1, as I am very certain it is an artistic, abstract design with no real-life representations.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1.0}"}
