{"id":"153028291","responseA":"The image you provided is of a wine bottle with a label. The label reads "Amarone della Valpolicella" indicating it is a type of Italian red wine. It is also branded as "ZENI 1870", suggesting the name of the producer and the founding year of the winery. The design appears quite elegant and traditional. At the top of the label, there is a small emblem which includes a depiction of a grapevine, but there are no clear images of animals or humans. I am very certain about this assessment, so on the scale of 0-1, I would say my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
