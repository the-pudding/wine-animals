{"id":"162906987","responseA":"The wine label features an illustration that includes grapevines and elements that sometimes resemble butterflies or insects in a stylized form. There are no clear images of animals or humans on the label. However, the interpretation of the artwork could be subjective. Given the abstract nature of the design, I would rate my certainty that there are no animals or humans as 0.8. The focus is on the vine and grape design, which is typical for a wine label, emphasizing the product's origin.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.8}"}
