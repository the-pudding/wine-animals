The label also includes "Vieilles Vignes," suggesting that the wine is made from old vines, and "Domaine Bachlet," likely referencing the producer or vineyard. There's an emblem or crest in the center, but no discernible animals or humans on the label. I am very certain (a confidence level of 1) there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
