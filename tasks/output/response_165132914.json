{"id":"165132914","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with an illustrated design. There are no clear images of animals or humans on the label; instead, it features what appears to be a stylized plant or flower coming out of a bottle, with a pattern of dots arching above it possibly depicting the aroma or a representation of growth, and two shapes near the bottom that might be interpreted as fruits or clay vessels.On a scale of 0-1 for certainty in identifying animals or humans, I would say 1, which means I am very certain that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
