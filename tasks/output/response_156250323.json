{"id":"156250323","responseA":"The image you've provided is of a wine label for "Fontodi Chianti Classico." The label features an illustration of a structure that appears to be a house or winery with trees surrounding it. I do not see any animals or humans on the label; it is purely an architectural and landscape illustration. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I am at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
