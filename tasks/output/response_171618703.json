{"id":"171618703","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. The label is primarily textual, with the words "Domaine Reverdy Ducroux" and "Le Ros√©" featured prominently. There appears to be a small logo or emblem at the top left corner, but it does not clearly represent an animal or human. I am very certain about my observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
