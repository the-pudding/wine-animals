{"id":"161484120","responseA":"The image you've provided is a photo of a wine bottle with a label that reads "Los Noques". There seems to be a coin or emblem featuring a profiled head, which could be interpreted as a depiction of a human. It's not a photograph or realistic drawing of a person but rather a stylized or emblematic representation, likely serving as a logo or symbol for the brand. On the scale you've provided, my certainty would be 1 that the label features a stylized depiction of a human profile within the emblem.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
