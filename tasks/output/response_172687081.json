{"id":"172687081","responseA":"In the image, there are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The label features the name "CUBA ETNA ROSSO DOC" along with a drawing of a building that looks like a historical or rural structure, possibly related to the location or history of the wine. There are also botanical illustrations, perhaps vines or local flora, and the logo or emblem of the winery "MONTELEONE" at the bottom. I am very certain (1) of my assessment as there are clearly no humans or animals in the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
