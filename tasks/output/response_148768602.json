{"id":"148768602","responseA":"There do not appear to be any animals or human figures on the wine label itself. It's a label for "Trapiche Costa & Pampa Brut Rose" from South Atlantic Wines. I am very certain, with a confidence level of 1, that there are no animals or human figures depicted on the label of the bottle itself. However, there is a reflection on the bottle which seems to include at least one person, but discussing or analyzing the reflection further would be against the guidelines.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
