{"id":"168349003","responseA":"The image displays a wine label for "Fattoria Rodano, Chianti Classico, Viacosta." The label features an emblem with what appears to be two animal figures, perhaps lions, positioned as heraldic supporters on either side of a shield. I am very certain that there are animal images depicted on the label, so my confidence level in identifying the presence of animals on the label is 1. There are no humans or human-like figures visible on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions", "certainty": 1}"}
