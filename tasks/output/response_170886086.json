{"id":"170886086","responseA":"On the wine label, there is an illustration of a human figure located at the center, depicted above a seashell, reminiscent of classical or Art Nouveau aesthetics. Additionally, there are two birds on either side of the human figure, which appear to be parrots (perhaps perruches specifically, given the name on the label). I am very certain about the presence of these elements; my certainty is 1. The wine is labeled as "Saumur Blanc," indicating it is a white wine from the Saumur region in France.","responseB":"{"animal": "human, parrots", "certainty": 1}"}
