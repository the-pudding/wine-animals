{"id":"163611483","responseA":"The image appears to show a depiction of a humanoid figure as part of the wine label artwork. The figure is stylized and illustrated in a way that resembles a human seated on a chair with grapevine elements surrounding it, which suggests a connection to wine and vineyards. I am very certain of this observation; my confidence level is 1. There are no real animals or humans on this label, only a representation as part of the design.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
