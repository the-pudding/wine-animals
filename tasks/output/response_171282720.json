{"id":"171282720","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that reads "DR. HEYDEN Oppenheimer Pinot Noir Unfiltered". The label includes a crest that appears to have a lion on it, which is part of the emblem or branding for the wine. There are no real animals or humans visible on the label. I am very certain about this interpretation of the image; on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
