{"id":"170765055","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is for a wine called "Riesling" from "Alsace" by "Domaine Christophe Mittnacht Terres d'étoiles." The label features a circular pattern of dots that resembles a constellation or stars, in line with the "Terres d'étoiles" name, which translates to "Lands of Stars" from French. I am very certain of this—my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
