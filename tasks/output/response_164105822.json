{"id":"164105822","responseA":"The image on the label depicts a landscape scene, which includes what appears to be plants, a building structure, and possibly a small figure that could be interpreted as a person due to its upright stance and what may be limbs, standing to the left of the structure. However, the figure is rather small and stylized, so the certainty that it's meant to represent a person is not absolute. On a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 represents complete certainty, I would place the certainty of the figure being a human as a 0.8, given the traditional cues for representing a human figure in a stylized form. The focus of the label is on the overall landscape, not detailed depiction of individuals.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.8}"}
