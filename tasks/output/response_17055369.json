{"id":"17055369","responseA":"On the wine label, there are illustrations that might represent either animals or humans as part of a crest or emblem at the top, and a building depicted at the bottom. Without clearer details, it's difficult to confidently discern specific elements within the crest. However, such crests often include animals or figures as part of heraldic tradition. My confidence level in the presence of animals or humans on the label would be approximately 0.5, given that there's a possibility, but no clear, discernible figures can be confirmed from this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.5}"}
