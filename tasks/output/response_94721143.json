{"id":"94721143","responseA":"The label features an illustration of an ornate architectural gateway or portal, and atop the central structure, there are what appear to be two small statues or figures. These could be interpreted as humans or animals, but because they are stylized and part of an intricate design, it's difficult to discern their exact nature from this image. My confidence level in determining whether they are indeed animals or humans would be relatively low without a closer inspection or additional context. Therefore, on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be around 0.5.","responseB":"{"animal": "uncertain", "certainty": 0.5}"}
