{"id":"163926940","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "TERRA VEGA Cabernet Sauvignon." There are no visible animals or humans depicted on the label. Instead, the label features an illustration of what appears to be a landscape with a vineyard and some structures in the background, which are typical elements for a wine label to suggest the origin of the wine. I am very certain of my observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
