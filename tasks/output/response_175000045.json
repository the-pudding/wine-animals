{"id":"175000045","responseA":"This image features a wine label with the text "Brovia" at the top. The label includes a graphic, which appears to be a stylized winged creature, reminiscent of a mythological griffin, a traditional symbol with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. There are no real animals or humans depicted on the label, just a graphic representation of a mythical creature. I am very certain (1) about this observation.","responseB":"{  "animal": "griffin",  "certainty": 1}"}
