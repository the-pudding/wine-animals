{"id":"160188137","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from "Barbaresco" with the specific vineyard name "Rabaja." Above the text, there is a crest that features a heraldic lion, which is an animal. The label also mentions "Castello di Verduno," indicating the producer, and "Verduno - Piemonte - Italia," detailing the location in Italy where the wine is from. My certainty level about the presence of the animal (the heraldic lion) on the label is 1, as it is clearly depicted in the crest on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "heraldic lion", "certainty": 1}"}
