{"id":"161841010","responseA":"The image shows a close-up of a wine bottle with a label that has the text "MDXV" (which could be interpreted as Roman numerals) and no visible animals or humans are shown on the label. I'm very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans depicted on this particular part of the wine label. However, the photo is closely cropped around the bottle, so there may be more to the label that isn't visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
