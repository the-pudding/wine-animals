{"id":"1401079","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label for Barolo, indicating that it's a red wine from Italy with an alcohol content of 14.5% by volume. The label includes various text elements such as the type of wine, the vineyard, and location details. There is a decorative element at the top of the label featuring what appears to be a crest with a letter "A" in the center and a pair of griffins facing away from a central shield.There are no real animals or humans on the label; rather, there are artistic representations or symbols in the form of griffins, which are mythological creatures with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. My certainty level in this context is 1, as I am very certain of the observations made from the image provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "griffin","certainty": 1}"}
