{"id":"167997129","responseA":"The image shows a wine label from "Sineann" brand for a Merlot wine, specifically from the Phinny Hill Vineyard in the Columbia Valley, dated 2017. The label features a graphic that could be interpreted as abstract or symbolic rather than a literal depiction of an animal or a human. The design might have elements that are reminiscent of various things depending on the viewer's interpretation, but it is not explicitly an animal or a human. I am 1 (very certain) that there is no clear depiction of an animal or a human on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
