{"id":"159816121","responseA":"The image displays a wine label for "Cuvaison Chardonnay" from the Napa Valley, Los Carneros region. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; instead, it features a geometric line drawing of what seems to be an arch or a doorway with a wine glass in front of it. I am very certain about this (1 on the scale of certainty), as the image is clear and the content on the label is straightforward with no human or animal figures.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
