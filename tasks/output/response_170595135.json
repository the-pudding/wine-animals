{"id":"170595135","responseA":"Based on the image you have provided, I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. Instead, it features an abstract design along with text. The label reads "Wairau River," which is the name of the wine, followed by "Sauvignon Blanc," indicating the type of wine. There's also a mention of "Rose Family Estate 1978," likely indicating the winery or the name of the estate where the wine is from, and "Marlborough New Zealand," denoting the region where this wine is produced. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
