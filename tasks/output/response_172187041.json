{"id":"172187041","responseA":"Based on the image provided, there are no animals or humans visible on the wine label. The label reads "Dragonette Cellars" and "MJM," presumably representing the name of the winery and the specific wine or blend. The design is quite minimalist and does not include any illustrations or depictions of animals or humans. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
