{"id":"172925714","responseA":"Yes, there is an image of a human on the wine label. It features an illustration of a girl's profile. As for animals, there is no clear depiction of an entire animal, but the name "Girl & Dragon" suggests that a dragon might be represented or suggested in the design, though it's not explicitly visible. My certainty level for the presence of a human depiction in the image is 1, as it's clearly part of the label's design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
