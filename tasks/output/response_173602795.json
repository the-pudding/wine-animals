{"id":"173602795","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Bourgogne Vézelay" indicating that the wine is from the Vézelay region in Burgundy, France. The label also has the name "Domaine Montanet-Thoden" which is likely the winemaker or winery. In the center of the label, there is a small illustration depicting what seems to be a mythical creature or a heraldic emblem. It features an image that could potentially be interpreted as part human, part animal due to the stylized nature of heraldic art; however, it does not depict any real humans or animals. My certainty is 0.5, as the complexity of heraldic images can sometimes make it challenging to categorically state the exact nature of the depicted figures without more context.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
