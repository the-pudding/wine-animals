{"id":"172101537","responseA":"The image features a wine label for "Chateau de Chasseloir," which appears to be a Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine sur lie wine. The label has an illustration of a chateau, suggesting that it may be the winery or location where the wine is produced. There are no visible animals or humans on this label. My certainty about the absence of animals or humans in this particular image is 1, meaning I am very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
