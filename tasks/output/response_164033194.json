{"id":"164033194","responseA":"The label has a graphic that may resemble a stylized interpretation of human eyes and eyebrows, or it could be seen as an abstract design depending on the viewer's interpretation. It's likely intended to be a minimalist representation of the concept of "3 Miradas," which translates to "3 Looks" or "3 Glances." On the certainty scale, I would rate my assessment as a 1 for being very certain that the label is designed to suggest human features but in an artistic and non-literal manner. There are no animals depicted on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
