{"id":"17461025","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with a coat of arms. On the coat of arms, there appears to be a depiction of some figures which might be interpreted as animals, though it is a stylized and artistic representation typical of heraldic designs. I am certain at a level of 1 that this is a coat of arms on a wine label and can freely comment on the stylistic and graphic elements it contains, but I cannot provide specifics about whether there are animals or humans without a more detailed and high-resolution view.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
