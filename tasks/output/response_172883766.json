{"id":"172883766","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label, specifically for "Brunello di Montalcino DOCG." The design on the label appears to feature a stylized silhouette of a person's profileâ€”it's an abstract human likeness rather than a detailed or realistic depiction. There are no clear animals present on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
