{"id":"167167138","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "La Bernardine Chateauneuf-du-Pape" by "M. Chapoutier". On the label, there is no depiction of any animals or humans. It is primarily a text-based label with some decorative elements, including what appears to be architectural columns, though the resolution isn't high enough to make out fine details. I am certain at a level of 1 that there are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
