{"id":"170911719","responseA":"This image depicts a wine bottle with a label that reads "Aim√© Arnoux Vacqueyras" and indicates it's a 2018 vintage wine. There is a coat of arms emblem at the top of the label. In the background, there is a blurred view of a dining scene with empty plates and glasses that suggest a meal was recently enjoyed.Regarding the presence of animals or humans on this label, I do not see any detailed illustrations or representations of either animals or humans on this part of the label.My confidence in this assessment is 1 (very certain), as I can clearly see and describe the contents of this image within the scope given. If there are any details not visible in the current view, I would not be able to comment on those.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
