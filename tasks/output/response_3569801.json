{"id":"3569801","responseA":"On this wine label, there is an illustration that depicts a horse-drawn carriage with what appears to be a driver and possibly passengers. The figures are stylized and are part of the traditional imagery often found on such labels. Whether or not they are classified as "animals" or "humans" would depend on the specific criteria used, but it is clear that the illustration intends to represent humans and horses. My certainty level about this interpretation of the illustration on the wine label would be 1, meaning I am very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse","certainty": 1}"}
