{"id":"163089412","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label presents the name "Stadlmann" and mentions it is a "Gr√ºner Veltliner," which is a type of white wine grape variety. There is an illustration of a building that appears to be a house or estate, but there are no clear images of animals or people. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
