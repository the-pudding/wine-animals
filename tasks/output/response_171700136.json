{"id":"171700136","responseA":"This image features a portrayal of what seems to be a human figure with what appears to be wings, resembling an angel or cherub, on a wine label. The artwork is set against a textured background and is part of the label design for "Little Bosco" wine. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say my certainty is 1. However, please note that without additional context, I cannot provide more details about the figure's origin, purpose, or the artist behind it.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
