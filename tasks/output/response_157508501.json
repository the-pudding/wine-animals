{"id":"157508501","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Champagne Taisne Riocour, Les Riceys - France, Grande RÃ©serve, Brut." There is a graphic above the text which appears to be a stylized image that could be interpreted as a sheep with three stars above it. My certainty level that the graphic represents a stylized animal is around 0.8 out of 1, as it's quite clear but still a simplified and artistic depiction. There are no human figures or real animals visible on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "sheep","certainty": 0.8}"}
