{"id":"175550763","responseA":"The label on the wine bottle features silhouettes that appear to be of humans. There are at least three discernible figures shaped like people. There also seems to be a silhouette that may represent a house or a building in the left-hand corner of the label. I don't see any animals on the label. I am very certain about the presence of human silhouettes, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
