{"id":"7064563","responseA":"In the image, there appears to be a small illustration with floral or vine-like patterns at the center of the wine label. There are no discernible animals or humans in the illustration; the image focuses primarily on the textual information indicative of the wine, its type "Barolo," which is an Italian wine denomination, and the wine producerâ€™s name "Parusso." There is also a specific name "Bussia" which could refer to the vineyard or specific area where the grapes are grown. Concerning the certainty of my assessment, as my responses are based on the information available in the image and do not involve subjective interpretation, I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans depicted on the wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
