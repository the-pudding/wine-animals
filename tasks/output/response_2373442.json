{"id":"2373442","responseA":"I can see that this image is of a wine label, specifically for "Vi√±a Tondonia," which is a product of Spain from the Rioja region, as indicated by the text. The label features classic graphic design elements, text, and what appears to be a small illustration of a building, likely a representation of the winery or estate.Regarding the presence of animals or humans on the label, the resolution and details make it a bit challenging to discern intricate elements, but there do not appear to be any clear depictions of animals or humans. I could be more confident with a higher resolution image or if I had additional context, but based on what is visible, it seems that the focus is on text and perhaps architectural graphics. Therefore, my certainty of there being no animals or humans depicted on this label would be around 0.9 on your specified scale.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.9}"}
