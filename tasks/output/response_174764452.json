{"id":"174764452","responseA":"The wine label displays several figures that appear to be both human and animal in nature as part of its artwork. There are characters that look like humans engaged in various activities, including one playing an instrument and others in a social gathering. Additionally, there seem to be animal figures depicted, possibly in motion or as part of the scene's narrative. On the certainty scale, I am at a 1, very certain that there are representations of both animals and humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "humans, animals","certainty": 1}"}
