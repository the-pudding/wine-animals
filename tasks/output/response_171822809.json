{"id":"171822809","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label that reads "MALBEC" at the top and "Earth First" towards the bottom. The label illustrates a pattern that appears to consist of vineyard or tree rows with some sort of red floral or fruit elements integrated into the design. This could be grapes or flowers, which are typical in vineyard imagery.There is no clear depiction of animals or humans on the label; it primarily features a stylized botanical motif. I'm certain at a level of 1 that the image does not contain animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
