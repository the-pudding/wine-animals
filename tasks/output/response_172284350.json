{"id":"172284350","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the name "Amarone Della Valpolicella" and "Aura di Valerie" on it. I see decorative elements and patterns that resemble grapevines and grapes, which are typical for wine labels, and there appears to be a small emblem with a shield and wings, possibly a heraldic symbol, at the top of the label. There are no animals or humans depicted on this label. I am very certain of this observation, so my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
