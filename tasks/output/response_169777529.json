It features the word "ENCROACHMENT" across the center in a bold font, with the vintage year "2017" below it. There also seems to be a design that resembles barbed wire crossing over the text. My certainty level is 1, meaning I am very certain there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
