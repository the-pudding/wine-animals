{"id":"171654918","responseA":"Based on the image, there appears to be a depiction of a human figure. It looks like a stylized drawing of a cherubic character, often referred to as a "putto," which is a representation of a chubby male child, usually nude and sometimes winged. Traditionally, putti are associated with aspects of classical art. I am certain that this is an artistic depiction of a human figure on the label, so I would say the certainty is 1. There are no real animals or humans visible, just the artwork on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
