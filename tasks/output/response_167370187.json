{"id":"167370187","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from "KÃ¼nstler," a vintage from 2015, specifying the wine is a Pinot Noir and it is dry. The label features a coat of arms which includes a crest with a helmet, and what appears to be a lion as one of the supporters of the shield. My certainty level about the presence of an animal depiction on the label is 1, meaning I am very certain that there is an animal depiction (the lion). There are no human figures or real animals on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
