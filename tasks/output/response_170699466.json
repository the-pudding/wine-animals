{"id":"170699466","responseA":"The label does not have any animals or humans on it; it features a geometric design with various colored squares and text that reads "Children of the revolution," "ros√© 2020," among other text. In the background, there appears to be a part of a person, however, since they are not the primary focus, that aspect is not as relevant. Regarding certainty about the absence of animals or humans on the label itself, I am 1 (very certain).","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
