{"id":"167875189","responseA":"The image displays a wine label for "Barone Fini Valdadige Pinot Grigio." There are no animals or humans depicted on the label in any realistic form; there appears to be a heraldic crest or coat of arms featuring stylized imagery, which often includes allegorical figures, but not explicit, detailed animals or humans in the usual sense. My certainty level is 1, meaning I am very certain of the absence of real animals or humans in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
