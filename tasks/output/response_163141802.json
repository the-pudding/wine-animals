For example, if the description of the wine label is:"The wine label features a beautifully hand-painted vibrant red fox jumping over grapevines."The JSON format you want is:{    "animal" : "Fox",    "certainty" : 1} In this example, the animal on the label is a fox and the certainty that the information is correct is 1(which means 100% certain). Only the assistant can be asked to produce a certainty assessment. Please note, no AI can guarantee 100% accuracy."}
