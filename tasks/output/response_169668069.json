{"id":"169668069","responseA":"The wine label features an illustration that looks like two lion-like creatures facing each other with what seems to be a vine or branch beneath them. There are no humans visible in the illustration. My certainty level regarding the presence of animals in the illustration on the label is 1, because the creatures represented are clearly meant to be animals, even though they are depicted in a stylized, artistic manner.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions","certainty": 1}"}
