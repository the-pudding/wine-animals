{"id":"154566294","responseA":"The image depicts a wine bottle label with artwork. The label reads "ANCIEN Carneros CHARDONNAY." The artwork above the text appears to portray a pastoral landscape with hills, possibly vineyards, and a few structures that could be farmhouses. There do not seem to be any distinct animals or humans present in the artwork; the focus is on the landscape. Without further visual context or detail, I can say with a confidence level of 1--very certain--that there are no explicit images of animals or humans, just the landscape artwork meant for the label design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
