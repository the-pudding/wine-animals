{"id":"156861128","responseA":"The label has a crest that features some small figures which could be interpreted as animals or possibly mythical creatures. There are no clear, distinct depictions of humans or animals as the main focus of the label. I would rate the certainty of not having a definitive animal or human depiction at 0.8, due to the stylized nature of the crest which may incorporate elements of both but does not provide a clear representation.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.8}"}
