{"id":"164019464","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with the name "Lez√≠ria Tinto." The design resembles a postal stamp with perforated edges and has a detailed illustration. Within the illustration, there appear to be human figures, specifically people working or gathering in a rural, possibly agricultural setting. There don't seem to be any prominent animals in the main scene. My certainty level regarding the presence of humans in the illustration on the label is 1, as the figures are clearly depicted and resemble human beings engaged in activities.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
