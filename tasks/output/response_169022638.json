{"id":"169022638","responseA":"I see an image of a wine bottle with the wine label clearly visible. The label reads "VIGILANCE" and provides information about the wine, including its type "CHARDONNAY", the region "RED HILLS, LAKE COUNTY", and that it is "SUSTAINABLY FARMED". The label features a decorative shield-like design with intricate patterns, but there are no visible animals or humans depicted on the label. I am very certain about my observation, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
