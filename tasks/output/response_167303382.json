{"id":"167303382","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "VINO DELL'AMICIZIA Veneto", specifically a Pinot Noir. The illustration on the label appears to include a group of people gathered, possibly in a vineyard setting with structures that resemble barrels and vines. I am very certain about the presence of human figures in the illustration; my certainty is 1 on the scale provided. There do not seem to be any clearly distinguishable animals in this part of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1.0}"}
