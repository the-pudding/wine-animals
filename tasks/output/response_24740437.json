{"id":"24740437","responseA":"The image shows an ornate design on a wine label for Chateau Ferriere, which includes a crest or coat of arms. At the top of the crest, there is a figure that appears to be a lion standing on its hind legs. This figure is typical in heraldic symbols, where animals are often used to represent qualities or lineage. I am very certain about the presence of the lion figure on this label, so I would rate my certainty as 1. There do not appear to be any humans depicted on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion","certainty": 1}"}
