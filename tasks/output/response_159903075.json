{"id":"159903075","responseA":"The image displays a wine label that reads "Los Vascos" and includes additional details such as "Carmenere Grande Reserve" and "Colchagua Chile". The illustration on the label depicts a rural estate with buildings and rows of what appear to be grapevines, representative of a vineyard.

I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
