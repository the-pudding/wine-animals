{"id":"171796600","responseA":"The image shows a wine label, specifically for Pierre de Fontval Cairanne, which is an appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) wine from the Rhône Valley. There are no animals or humans depicted on this label, but there is a stylized crest or coat of arms with a crowned shield featuring a pattern that could be floral or vegetal. The crest is flanked by two crossed keys. My certainty on this observation is 1, as I can clearly see and describe the image based on the visual information provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
