{"id":"171992143","responseA":"The label includes images of various objects but no animals or humans. There are illustrations of items like a guitar, glasses, a bottle, a fish, a grill, a baguette, a paintbrush, and a hot air balloon, among others. These are symbolic representations of different things one might enjoy at a party ("La FÃªte" in French), such as music, wine, cheese, fish, grilling, bread, painting, crafts, and presumably friends and fun (as indicated by the text). I am very certain (1) that there are no real animals or humans pictured on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
