{"id":"18784379","responseA":"In the image provided, there are no clearly discernible animals or humans depicted. The label features text and a drawing of a building that appears to be a château, which reflects the name of the wine, "Château Larose." There is also a crest or coat of arms at the top center of the label, but it does not show a detailed animal or human figure. My certainty level is very high, so I would rate it as 1 on the scale of certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
