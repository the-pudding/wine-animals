{"id":"150688893","responseA":"The image showcases a wine bottle with a label that features the name "STEPHANIE" in large, capitalized, serif lettering at the top and a harp in the center. Below the harp, it states "Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon" indicating the type of wine and the region it comes from. There are no animals or humans depicted on this label, only the harp which is a musical instrument. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
