{"id":"19387652","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that features a coat of arms with a mythical creature. The creature is a heraldic representation that looks like a lion with some dragon-like features; such depictions are common in heraldry and do not represent real animals. I would say with certainty close to 1 that the image is of a wine label with a stylized, mythical animal depicted on it. No real animals or humans are present in the image.","responseB":"{  "animal": "mythical creature",  "certainty": 1}"}
