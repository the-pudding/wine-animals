{"id":"163303262","responseA":"The image appears to be of a wine bottle with a label that reads "SHOTFIRE BAROSSA QUARTAGE" with the name "THORN-CLARKE BAROSSA WINEMAKERS" at the bottom. The central part of the label features an illustration, which depicts a pair of hands performing what looks like manual labor, possibly related to the wine-making process. I do not see any animals or humans; the illustration seems to focus only on hands. I'm very certain about my observations, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
