{"id":"167073410","responseA":"The image is of a wine bottle label that reads "PRAZO DE RORIZ," indicating the brand or the name of the wine estate. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; instead, there is a sketch that appears to represent a landscape scene with some structures, likely buildings, which could be part of the winery or estate represented by the label. Based on the information presented in the image, I am very certain of my observations, so on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 being 'very certain', I would say my certainty is at 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
