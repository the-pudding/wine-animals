{"id":"166387917","responseA":"The image displays a wine label that reads "Orthogneiss" from "Domaine de l'Ecu" in the Muscadet Sevre et Maine appellation. I do not see any animals or humans on the label; it features text, a graphic design that seems to resemble a geological formation (likely an orthogneiss rock), and a small symbol in the top right corner that appears to be a vine or plant-related logo. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
