{"id":"160114597","responseA":"The image displays a wine label that reads "Palacio del Burgo," a red wine from the Rioja region. There are no clear, discernible animals or humans on the label; instead, there is an illustration that appears to depict a scene with buildings, possibly hinting at a historic or culturally significant structure. My certainty level is 1, meaning I am very certain that the image of the label does not prominently feature animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
