{"id":"165618026","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Chateau Quintus." The label design features a central emblem with a profile depiction of what seems to be a classical bust. The image is not clear or detailed enough to confirm if the profile represents a human, a deity, or an allegorical figure, which is common in classical and neoclassical art. As such, I would say my certainty is around 0.5, since it is not explicit if the figure is meant to represent a real human being or is purely a decorative element.
