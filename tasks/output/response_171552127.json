{"id":"171552127","responseA":"The label in the image features stylized text and design elements typically found on wine labels. There is an emblem which appears to be a crest or symbol at the top, which includes a small figure that could be interpreted as either decorative or as a stylized animal or human figure due to its abstract nature. Given the ornamental quality and the common practice of using various elements in crests or logos, it is not clearly identifiable as a specific animal or human. My certainty level would be around 0.5 due to the ambiguity of the emblem in the traditional design.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
