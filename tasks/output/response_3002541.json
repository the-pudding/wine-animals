{"id":"3002541","responseA":"There does appear to be an image of at least one human depicted on the label. Specifically, there's a small figure of a person standing near the bottom left of the central illustration. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, I would say my certainty is 1. There are no clear depictions of animals on the label from what I can see.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
