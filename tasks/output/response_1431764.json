{"id":"1431764","responseA":"The image on the wine label does not clearly depict any animals or humans. It appears to be a representation of a landscape or map-like illustration within a circular border.

I am very certain about this observationâ€”a 1 on the scale of certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
