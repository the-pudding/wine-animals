{"id":"169183666","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is prominently text-based, with the main focus on the name of the wine, "POUILLY-FUISSÉ," and additional details like "CHÂTEAU DES RONTS" and "Les Birbettes" which likely denote the provenance and specific vineyard or batch. It also contains practical information such as the alcohol content, bottle volume, and indication that it's a product of France.I am 1, or very certain, that there are no animals or humans depicted in this image because it's a straightforward presentation of a wine label with textual information and no illustrative elements.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
