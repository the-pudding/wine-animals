It features the word "WANDERLUST" prominently, with some additional text and a design element that resembles an airplane symbol above it. The overall design is typically for a wine bottle label, aiming to evoke a sense of adventure or travel, possibly to appeal to consumers with an interest in exploring or tasting wines from different regions. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
