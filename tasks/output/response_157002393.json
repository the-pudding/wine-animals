{"id":"157002393","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label with the name "Bello Family Vineyards." The label includes a design with two lions facing each other, which is a common heraldic element. There are no actual animals or humans in this image, only a graphical representation of animals. I am very certain of this, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions","certainty": 1}"}
