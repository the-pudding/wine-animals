{"id":"4682307","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is for a wine called "Bernardus Marinus," which is described as a Carmel Valley Red Wine with an alcohol content of 14.1% by volume. The design includes a crest with a shield and some ornate detailing that could be interpreted as stylized animals, but it is an emblematic design rather than a depiction of actual animals. I am very certain (1) that there are no real animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
