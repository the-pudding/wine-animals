{"id":"174302703","responseA":"There are no images of animals or humans on the wine label. I am 1 (very certain) about this. The label is for a Sancerre wine, which is a type of white wine from the Loire valley in France, specifically appellation Sancerre contrôlée. The producer is Henry Natter, and the label displays some information about the wine and the vineyard, such as the location of Montigny and the website. There is a small coat of arms which features a design that could be interpreted as having elements resembling animals such as lions or birds which is quite common in heraldry, but they are stylistic representations and part of the coat of arms design, not actual animals.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
