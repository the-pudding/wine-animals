{"id":"172889893","responseA":"This wine label, "CLURICAUN," does not feature any clear images of animals or humans. The design is abstract and artistic, with a central orange circle and what seem to be decorative markings or splashes of color around it. There are also what appear to be tiny geometric shapes or icons scattered on the design, but none of them resemble animals or humans. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, I would say my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
