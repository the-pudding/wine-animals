{"id":"159831833","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with an embossed or raised design, featuring a coat of arms. At the top of the emblem, there do appear to be two animal figures that may be reminiscent of dragons or mythological creatures, positioned symmetrically on either side. There are no humans depicted on the label. My certainty level regarding the presence of animal-like figures on the label is 1; I'm very certain there are representations of animals as part of the coat of arms design.","responseB":"{"animal": "dragons", "certainty": 1}"}
