{"id":"1224880","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label for "Château Léoville Barton." There are no images of animals or humans on the main part of the label featuring the building; however, there is a small crest or emblem near the bottom that appears to include an animal, likely a lion or some other heraldic creature commonly used in coats of arms. My certainty regarding the presence of an animal in the emblem is about 0.9, as it is a small part of the label and stylistically represented, which can sometimes be open to interpretation.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 0.9}"}
