{"id":"173441584","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with abstract artistic elements. The upper part of the label features what appears to be a stylized plant or flower, characterized by white outlines on a dark background. In the lower part, there are patches of color that look like an expressionist or impressionist painting technique with no discernible figures of animals or humans. Therefore, on a scale from 0 to 1 regarding the presence of animals or humans in this image, I would say a 0, as I am very certain there are no animals or humans depicted on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
