{"id":"175882006","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label you've shown me. The label appears to be text-based with the prominent message, "La capitulation NE PAIE PAS!" This suggests the label is focusing on the message it is conveying rather than depicting animals or humans. I would say with a certainty of 1 that there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
