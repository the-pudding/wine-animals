{"id":"156901395","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features the word "SALT" followed by a smaller inscription "vine". The label has a rustic, somewhat weathered look with a patina that might suggest age or a particular style associated with the brand. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
