{"id":"156572163","responseA":"Yes, I see a stylized human figure on the wine label; it's in the center and appears to be holding up what looks like a vine or branches with leaves and possibly grapes. I am very certain about this observation, so on the scale of 0-1, I would say 1 (very certain). There are no animals visible on the label, just the human figure and vegetative designs that are common on wine labels to signify the origin and nature of the wine.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 1}"}
