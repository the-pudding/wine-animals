{"id":"165673396","responseA":"This image depicts a wine label with the text "MAINOVA milmat," and it lists the types of grapes used in the wine, such as Arinto, Verdelho, Encruzado, and Ant√£o Vaz. The label shows an illustration, but it appears to be of a vine or a grape bunch, rather than an animal or a human. I am certain at a level of 1 that there are no clear depictions of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
