{"id":"161215531","responseA":"I can see a drawing on the label that appears to represent a rural or vineyard scene, although it is stylized and not very detailed. There appear to be trees or bushes, a structure that could be a small building or part of a wall, and possibly vines. I do not see any clear depiction of animals or humans on the label. My certainty level is 0.95, as the image is not highly detailed and interpretations could vary slightly.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.95}"}
