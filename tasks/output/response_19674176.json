{"id":"19674176","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Chateau Brown Pessac-LÃ©ognan," which indicates it is a Grand Vin de Graves. The label features an illustration of a chateau with trees, rows of what appear to be vineyards, and a partly cloudy sky. There are no animals or humans visible in the illustration on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
