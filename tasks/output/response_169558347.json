{"id":"169558347","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Bergstr√∂m Old Stones Oregon Chardonnay Willamette Valley." On the label, there is a crest or coat of arms that features illustrations of grapevines and what appears to be agricultural landscapes, but there are no clear images of animals or humans depicted on this label. As for the certainty of my observation, I would say I'm 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans depicted because the label elements are clearly distinguishable.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
