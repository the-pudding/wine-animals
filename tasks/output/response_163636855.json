Instead, the label displays the name "TERTRE BLANC" and an illustration of a ch√¢teau or estate, which is a common design motif for wine labels that wish to emphasize their heritage and quality. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being 'very certain', I am at 1 in terms of certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
