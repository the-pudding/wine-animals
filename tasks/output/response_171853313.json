{"id":"171853313","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "FLOWERS Vineyards & Winery Rose Wine Sonoma Coast." There are no animals or humans visible on this label. There is a graphic design that appears to be a stylized flower, but it does not resemble an animal or human. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say 1, indicating that I am very certain there are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
