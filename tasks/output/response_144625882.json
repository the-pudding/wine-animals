{"id":"144625882","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Les Terrasses de Saint Christophe," indicating that it's a Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru wine. The label's design features a graphic of a building, possibly a chateau, and what seems to be rows of vines or terraced land associated with vineyards. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label. I am very certain about this, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
