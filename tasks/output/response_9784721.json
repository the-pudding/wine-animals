{"id":"9784721","responseA":"The image shows a wine label specifically for "Quinta do Escudial da DÃ£o Garrafeira 2008 Vinhas Velhas Product of Portugal." There are no animals or humans visible on the label; rather, it features text, some graphic elements like a cross, and a symbol that might represent a crest or an emblem associated with the wine estate. I am very certain that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label, so my confidence level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
