{"id":"174728274","responseA":"Yes, there is an animal depicted on this wine label. It features an illustration of a bear sitting down, surrounded by foliage and what appears to be grapevines, which is fitting for a wine label. There are no humans visible on the label. I am very certain about my observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "bear",  "certainty": 1}"}
