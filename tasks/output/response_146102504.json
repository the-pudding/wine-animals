{"id":"146102504","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Ornellaia" which is labeled as "Toscana Bianco," indicating it is a white wine from Tuscany, Italy. There is an illustration of what appears to be a rural estate or vineyard with buildings, trees, and possibly a mountain in the background. There are no animals or humans visible in this illustration. I'm very certain about this, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
