{"id":"170824242","responseA":"The image features a label on a bottle of Ros√© wine. There is an illustration of a mythological creature that appears to be a mermaid (human upper body with a fish tail) in the foreground. In the background, there are depictions of boats and a coastal cityscape. I am very certain (1) that there are both human-like and animal-like figures on this label, with the mermaid being a blend of both. The other figures on boats or within the city are too small to detail but appear human-like in nature.","responseB":"{"animal": "mermaid","certainty": 1}"}
