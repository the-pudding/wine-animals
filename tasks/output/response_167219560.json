{"id":"167219560","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label that reads "PÃ¨re et Fils," followed by "Cinsault Syrah" which likely refers to the types of grapes used in the wine. The label includes names but these appear to be related to the winemakers or the brand. There are no visible images of animals or humans on the label. My certainty level is 1, as the label consists of text and a textured but non-representational background.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
