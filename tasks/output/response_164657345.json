{"id":"164657345","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for a red wine called "Cuv√©e Terroir" from the Chinon appellation. There appears to be a small emblem at the top of the label that includes an illustration of what might be a person's face within a frame or crest. I am very certain that the emblem is present; however, without a clearer image or additional information, I cannot provide more detail about the illustration. Therefore, I am certain that there is an emblem (1), but less certain about the specific details of the image within that emblem.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.5}"}
