{"id":"159905275","responseA":"The image depicts a bottle of wine with the label "AUTORITAS MERLOT WINE OF CHILE." At the top of the label, there is an illustration of a crest or coat of arms which traditionally can feature animals, but the specific details in this image make it difficult to discern any individual animals. There are no humans or animals depicted clearly or realistically on the wine label itself. My certainty level regarding the absence of clear images of humans or animals on the label is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
