{"id":"172243504","responseA":"The label of the wine bottle features what appears to be an abstract representation of a human figure. The image seems to be intentionally stylized to focus on form and color rather than detailed representation. I'm certain this interpretation aligns with the visible design elements, so on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being very certain, I would say I am at 1, acknowledging that the representation is abstract and open to individual interpretation.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
