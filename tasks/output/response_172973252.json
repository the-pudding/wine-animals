{"id":"172973252","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for a Sauvignon Blanc by Details by Sinegal. At the top of the label, there is a graphic that appears to be the silhouette of a bull's head with intricate designs within. There are no humans or living animals depicted in this image, just the graphic representation of a bull's head. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "bull", "certainty": 1}"}
