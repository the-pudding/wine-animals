{"id":"107654716","responseA":"The label features an emblem that resembles a coat of arms flanked by what appear to be grapevine motifs. The coat of arms includes a symbol that could be interpreted as an animal, likely a lion, depicted in a stylized, heraldic manner. There are no depictions of humans on the label. My certainty level regarding the presence of an animal-like symbol on the label is 1, meaning I am very certain. However, this interpretation is based on heraldic styling and is not indicative of a real animal.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
