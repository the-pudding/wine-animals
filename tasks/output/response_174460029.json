{"id":"174460029","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The image depicts what seems to be a drawing of a building—possibly a tower or windmill structure—along with a smaller house-like structure. The text on the label reads "PEJU," which is likely the brand name of the wine, "Sauvignon Blanc," indicating the type of wine, and "NAPA VALLEY," suggesting the region where the wine is from. My certainty is 1, as I am confident in my assessment of the contents of the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
