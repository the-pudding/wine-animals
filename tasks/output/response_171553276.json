{"id":"171553276","responseA":"The image contains an illustration of two human figures on a wine label. The art style is sketch-like, with outline drawings depicting what appears to be a woman standing on the right with a bottle to her mouth, and a figure on the left is shown from the back without a clear depiction of gender. There are no animals visible in this illustration. I am very certain about these observations, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
