{"id":"161623676","responseA":"The image displays an abstract artistic depiction on a wine label for a product named "Monrose" by Mamete Prevostini. The artwork, while abstract, does not seem to clearly represent any animals or humans; it appears to be more of a stylized combination of colors and shapes perhaps meant to be evocative of the wine's character or the vineyard's aesthetic. Given the abstract nature of the image, I would say I am 1 (very certain) that there are no explicit representations of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
