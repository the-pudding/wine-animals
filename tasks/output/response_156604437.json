{"id":"156604437","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It's a label for a Barolo wine with the name "Cannubi" featured prominently at the top, indicating the specific vineyard or area where the grapes are grown. The image contains a landscape scene that appears to be vineyards, typical of a wine label design. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
