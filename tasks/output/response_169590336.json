{"id":"169590336","responseA":"The image depicts the label of a wine bottle. On it, there is a crest that features lions on both sides, supporting a shield and a crown above it. Animals are depicted on this label, but they are part of a heraldic crest and are not real animals. I am very certain of this description, so I would rate my certainty as 1. There are no humans or real animals in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions", "certainty": 1}"}
