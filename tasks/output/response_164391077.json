{"id":"164391077","responseA":"I see drawings that might represent humans on the label, characterized by stick-figure like forms. These forms consist of simple lines for arms, legs, and torsos with circular heads, which are commonly used to symbolize humans in a simplistic artistic style. There are no clear representations of animals visible on the label. My certainty level that the images represent humans in a very abstract way is 1. However, as this is a stylized artistic representation, interpretations can vary.","responseB":"{  "animal": "humans",  "certainty": 1}"}
