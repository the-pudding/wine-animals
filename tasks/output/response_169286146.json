{"id":"169286146","responseA":"The image is of a wine bottle label that reads "FRONTÓN DE ORO BLANCO AFRTUADO" and indicates it is from "Islas Canarias" with a designation of origin protected status ("Denominación de Origen Protegida"). The label depicts a graphical element, which could be interpreted abstractly, but it does not explicitly appear to be an animal or a human. On a scale from 0 to 1 regarding certainty, I would rate my certainty that there are no explicit animals or humans on this wine label at a 1 – very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
