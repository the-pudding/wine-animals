{"id":"162906249","responseA":"The image shows a wine label from Silverado Vineyards, specifically for a Chardonnay wine. The label depicts an illustration of a landscape which includes a vineyard with rows of grapevines and buildings, presumably part of the estate. There do not appear to be any animals or humans in the illustration on the label. I am fairly certain (near 1) in my observation because the label is clear and no figures resembling humans or animals are visible within the illustrated landscape.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
