{"id":"1485583","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "Contadi Castaldi BRUT FRANCIACORTA." There are no animals or humans depicted on this label.

I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
