{"id":"172121632","responseA":"The label features an emblem or coat of arms with segmented areas containing different designs. I can see that there is a lion on the upper left section and an eagle on the upper right section of the shield within the emblem. These represent animals in a symbolic and heraldic form but not in a realistic depiction. There are no humans or real animals visible on this wine label. I am very certain about my observations, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion, eagle","certainty": 1}"}
