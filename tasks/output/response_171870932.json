{"id":"171870932","responseA":"On the wine label, there is an illustration of an animal which appears to be an elephant on the right side and a smaller animal that resembles a mouse on the left side. They are positioned on a curved line, giving the impression that they are on a seesaw. This is stylized artwork and not a photographic representation of actual animals. I am certain at a level of 1 that there are no real humans or real animals depicted on this label; they are drawings.","responseB":"{  "animal": "elephant, mouse",  "certainty": 1}"}
