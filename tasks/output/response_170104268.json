{"id":"170104268","responseA":"Yes, there is an image of a person on the wine label. It appears to be a child depicted in a peaceful, sleeping pose. The text humorously suggests a moment of relief or relaxation implied by "The kids are finally asleep." This design choice seems aimed at creating a relatable or emotive connection with the consumer, likely those with children who understand the sentiment. I am very certain that the image is of a human; I would rate this certainty as 1 on your scale. However, I am not allowed to identify the specific individual depicted. Please let me know if you have any other questions about this label or wine in general.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
