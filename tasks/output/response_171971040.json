{"id":"171971040","responseA":"The wine label image appears to feature a human element. There is a depiction of a hand gesture commonly referred to as the "peace sign," where two fingers are raised to symbolize peace or victory. These fingers are adorned with faces that appear to resemble human attributes.There are no clear depictions of whole animals or humans, just the stylized representation of human fingers and faces on them. On the certainty scale regarding the presence of a depiction of human elements, I would rate it at 1, being very certain, as it is clear from the image that the hand gesture and faces are intended to represent human features.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 1}"}
