{"id":"174212448","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of Chardonnay wine from Martin Woods, specifically the 2019 vintage from the Koosah Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills of Willamette Valley. The label has an illustration at the bottom which features what appears to be plants, possibly grapevines or something similar. There don't seem to be any animals or humans depicted in the illustration. My certainty level is 1, as I'm very certain about the absence of animals or humans on this part of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
