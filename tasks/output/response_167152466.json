{"id":"167152466","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label for "Minchinbury Shiraz" from Australia. On the label, there is a crest that includes an illustration of a creature that resembles a lion, which is a common emblematic animal used in heraldry. This depiction is stylized and not a photograph of an actual animal. There are no humans or other animals visible in this image aside from the stylized heraldic lion. I am certain (1) that what I am describing is an accurate representation of the visual content of the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
