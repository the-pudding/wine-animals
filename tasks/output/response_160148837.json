{"id":"160148837","responseA":"The image features a wine label with the word "ALLENDE" prominently displayed and "RIOJA" indicating its region of origin. At the top of the label, there is a graphic of a heraldic animal, which looks like a stylized lion. There are no images of real humans or animals on the label. I am very certain of this, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
