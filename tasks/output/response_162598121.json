{"id":"162598121","responseA":"This image features a wine label with the name "Bergström" prominently displayed, indicating the wine is a Pinot Noir from Oregon, produced in the Chehalem Mountains AVA region. The crest on the label does not contain any clear depictions of animals or humans—it appears to be adorned with a decorative design of vines and grapes, common themes for a wine label. I am 1 (very certain) that there are no humans or animals depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
