{"id":"161655025","responseA":"There do not appear to be any animals or humans depicted on the wine label in the image. The design consists primarily of text that reads "BASILISCO" and "Cruda". At the top, there is an embossed seal that seems to feature a historical or symbolic figure, potentially reminiscent of a coin or emblem. I would say with a certainty of 1 that there are no real animals or humans present in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
