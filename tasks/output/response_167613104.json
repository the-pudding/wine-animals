{"id":"167613104","responseA":"The wine label features a stylized depiction of a human and a bird. The human figure appears to be a woman with her hair up, smiling or laughing, with a playful and dynamic design. There is also a bird perched atop what seems like her head, possibly a crow or a raven, holding grapes in its beak. The level of certainty regarding the presence of these figures is 1, as the artwork clearly illustrates both a human and an animal.","responseB":"{"animal": "human, bird","certainty": 1}"}
