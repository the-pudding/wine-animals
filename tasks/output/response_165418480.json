{"id":"165418480","responseA":"The image displays an emblem of what appears to be a heraldic creature which might be a lion or a similar animal, presented in a stylized manner as it is typical for crests or logos. There are no real animals or humans depicted on the label. Given the context and visual information, my certainty is close to 1, as this is a standard convention for wine labels and the depicted image is clearly intended as a graphic design element rather than a representation of a real-life scene.","responseB":"{  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": 1}"}
