{"id":"164652514","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that features butterflies and leaves with a background that hints at a human silhouette but doesn't show any detailed features. I can confirm that there are no clear images of animals or humans in the detail that one might expect for a typical portrayal. There are elements resembling butterflies, which classify as animals, but they are stylized and part of the label's artwork rather than real animals. I am very certain (1) about the presence of butterflies in an artistic context on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "butterflies","certainty": 1}"}
