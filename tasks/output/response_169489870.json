{"id":"169489870","responseA":"The image shows a wine label, and there are no animals or humans depicted on it. The label is text-focused, providing details about the wine such as the region ("Saint-Aubin"), the quality classification ("1er Cru"), and the specific place or vineyard designation ("En Remilly"). Additionally, there is information about the producer ("Domaine Sylvain Langoureau"), the type of wine ("White Burgundy Wine"), and the country of origin ("Product of France"). The label design includes a decorative element suggestive of a crest or heraldic symbol above the text, which is common in wine label designs but does not depict a human or an animal. My certainty level about the absence of animals or humans in this image is 1, very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
