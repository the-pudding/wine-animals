{"id":"165032195","responseA":"The image appears to show a wine label with the brand name "Fairvalley" and the indication that it is from South Africa. The label features a phrase "the hands that work the soil feed the soul." and mentions the type of wine as "PINOTAGE." There is a graphic that includes a stylized representation of a hand, but there are no real humans or animals depicted on the label. Therefore, on a scale of 0 to 1 regarding the presence of real humans or animals, I am certain at a level of 1 that there are none depicted.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
