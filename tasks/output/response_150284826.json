{"id":"150284826","responseA":"The label features imagery that includes two human-like figures at the top, appearing to be cherubs or putti, which are commonly used decorative elements that evoke a sense of tradition and classicism. There don't appear to be any real animals on the label from what can be seen. My certainty level is high; I would say 1, as the rendering is quite clear.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
