{"id":"165013438","responseA":"The wine label features a small graphic of what appears to be an animal, specifically a bear's head in a minimalist style adjacent to a radiant design. I am very certain (1) that the graphic represents an animal, albeit stylized for branding purposes. There are no human figures or depictions of specific individuals on the label. The label is for a Gevrey-Chambertin wine, indicating it's from the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation in France, and it's from old vines ("Vieilles Vignes") by Domaine Michel Magnien.","responseB":"{"animal": "bear", "certainty": 1}"}
