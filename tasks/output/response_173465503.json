{"id":"173465503","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label you've presented. The label is mostly textual, with the name of the winery "Meyer-Fonné," specifying the type of wine as "Riesling" and the designation "Réserve." It also includes additional information such as the wine region ("Vin d'Alsace"), and the names "François et Félix Meyer, vignerons," indicating the winemakers. The image above the text appears to be a graphic or logo, which resembles a stylized building or structure but not an animal or human. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain of my assessment of the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
