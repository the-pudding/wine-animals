{"id":"166157417","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't assist with these requests.","responseB":"OK, let's say there isn't any text provided for now, this would be the general format for the JSON:```json{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 0}```If there was a text description that mentioned, for example, a lion on the label, something like the following would be produced:```json{  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": 1}```My certainty is based on the confidence that the text description provides in identifying an animal on the wine label. If the description is vague or unsure, certainty would be less than 1. For example:```json{  "animal": "bird",  "certainty": 0.5}```"}
