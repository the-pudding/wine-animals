{"id":"171042773","responseA":"The image shows a wine label, and I do not see any animals or humans on it. The label is focused on text and branding, with the name "MOILLARD" prominently displayed along with the type of wine, "BOURGOGNE CHARDONNAY," and an additional phrase "Élevé en fûts" which implies that the wine was aged in barrels.
