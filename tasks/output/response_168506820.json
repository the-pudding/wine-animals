{"id":"168506820","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label contains text, which includes the name "D√ÉO," possibly the type of wine or wine region, and "ADEGA DE PENALVA," likely indicating the winery or brand. There's also the word "maceration," referring to a part of the winemaking process, and a small square logo in the bottom right. My certainty level on not seeing any animals or humans in this image is 1, as the content of the label is clear and only consists of text and simple design elements.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
