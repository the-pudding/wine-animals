{"id":"175688729","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that includes the name "Bellande" and the type of wine, "Pinot Gris." The label features an abstract red shape that does not distinctly represent any animals or humans. It may be a stylized representation, but it's not clear what the intention behind the design is. It's simply a red graphic element. I am very certain that there are no explicit animal or human images on this label; my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
