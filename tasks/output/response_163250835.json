{"id":"163250835","responseA":"Yes, I see human figures on the wine label. They appear to be in a setting that looks like a small village or a rural area. I cannot comment on the identities or further personal details of these figures as they are likely intended as part of the design aesthetic rather than as identifiable individuals. There is also a dog visible on the label next to the human figures. My confidence level in identifying the presence of human figures and a dog is 1 or 'very certain'.","responseB":"{"animal": "human, dog","certainty": 1}"}
