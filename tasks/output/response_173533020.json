{"id":"173533020","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the word "HALL" at the top, indicating the brand name of the wine. Below that, it reads "Sauvignon Blanc", which is the type of wine, and "Napa Valley", pointing to the region the wine is from. There is a small graphic of what appears to be a rabbit in mid-leap towards the bottom of the label. I am very certain this is an image of a wine label â€“ 1 out of 1 on the certainty scale. However, without a direct visual identification possible, I cannot be certain about specific details such as the rabbit beyond what the label suggests.","responseB":"{"animal": "rabbit", "certainty": 0.9}"}
