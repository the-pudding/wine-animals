{"id":"156220005","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label that reads "MITOLO JESTER SHIRAZ MCLAREN VALE 750mL". There is an emblem on the label that appears to be an abstract design, possibly representing a jesters' hat, but there are no clear depictions of animals or humans on it. My certainty level that there are no animals or humans on this label is 1 (very certain).","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
