{"id":"173445766","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for a wine named "TOSCA" from Orvieto Classico, 2021. The label features an illustration of a stately building, which could be a winery or estate, surrounded by what appears to be vineyard rows. There's also a crest or shield with a lion, which is an animal depicted on the label. There are no humans or living animals visible; all imagery is artistic representation. My certainty level regarding the absence of real animals or humans in this image is 1, as I detect only illustrations and text on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion","certainty": 1}"}
