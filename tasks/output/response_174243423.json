{"id":"174243423","responseA":"In the image, there are no visible animals or humans. It is a wine label from Alsace, for a wine called "Clos Windsbuhl," a Pinot Gris by Domaine Zind Humbrecht. The label features text and a graphic of a vineyard landscape, which is quite common on wine labels. I am very certain about this, so on a scale from 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
