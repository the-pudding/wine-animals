{"id":"147840670","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't assist with these requests.","responseB":"Apologies for the confusion earlier. Following is an example of the helper function to assess a wine label:If the description of the wine label says: "The label is beautifully designed with a drawing of a proud lion standing on a sunflower field"The resultant JSON would be:```json{  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": 1}```In a scenario where no animal or human is mentioned in the description, for example if the description says: "The label is simply decorated with a bunch of grapes and a wine bottle"The resultant JSON should look like:```json{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}```Keep in mind, the 'certainty' value is subjective to the clarity of the description provided and may vary."}
