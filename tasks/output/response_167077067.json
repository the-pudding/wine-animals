{"id":"167077067","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Puligny-Montrachet", which is a white Burgundy wine and indicates that it is a product of France. The label features a crest with a design that could be interpreted as featuring botanical elements like leaves and perhaps some stylized stars, but there are no animals or human figures depicted. My certainty level that there are no animals or humans is 1 â€“ very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
