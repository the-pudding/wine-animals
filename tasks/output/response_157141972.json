{"id":"157141972","responseA":"Yes, there are animals on this wine label. At the top of the illustration, there is a dog standing on the back of a larger animal, possibly a boar, which in turn is standing on top of a barrel. Additionally, there is a bird perched on a ladder that leans against the barrel, and a small animal, possibly another dog, at the bottom right corner of the barrel. I am very certain about the presence of these illustrated animals on the label, so on a scale from 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "dog, boar, bird", "certainty": 1}"}
