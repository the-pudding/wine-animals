{"id":"173679790","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. This label appears to display the name of the wine, "PETRALUCE VERDECA," and indicates that it is from the Salento I.G.T. region. Additionally, there is the name "CASTELLO MONACI" featured prominently, which is likely the name of the winery or producer. My certainty level is 1, as I am very sure that there are no animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
