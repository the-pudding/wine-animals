Here's an example of how to utilize the information provided in the form of a JSON response:Given text: "The wine label displays a majestic lion prowling in the savannah against a sunset backdrop."JSON response: {  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": 1}In the statement, the presence of a "lion" is explicitly stated. Hence, under the key "animal", "lion" is the corresponding value. Since the presence of the lion is a sure fact in the text provided, "certainty" is noted down as 1, suggesting 100% certainty."}
