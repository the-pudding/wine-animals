{"id":"1874305","responseA":"The image displays a wine label for Chateau Duhart-Milon, which is indicated as a wine from the Pauillac region and a Grand Cru Class√©. The label features a detailed drawing of a landscape which includes a building that looks like a chateau and a tree-lined area. A boat is depicted on what appears to be a body of water in front of the chateau. There are no animals or humans discernible on the label. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
