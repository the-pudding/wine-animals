{"id":"167555994","responseA":"The image appears to be of a wine label for a Riesling called "Saarstein." The label includes a black-and-white photograph that seems to be of a vineyard landscape. There are no clear images of animals or humans on it; the focus is on the scenery, which likely pertains to the location where the wine is produced. The label also provides other information such as the alcohol content, which is 10% by volume, and the bottle's capacity, which is 750 ml. Based on the image provided, I am certain (1) that there are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
