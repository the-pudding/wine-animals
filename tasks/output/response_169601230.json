{"id":"169601230","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the brand "Mahi Marlborough" and specifies that it is a Pinot Noir from Marlborough, New Zealand. The label does not depict any animals or humans; there is a small graphic that could be interpreted as a stylized spiral or snail-like symbol in the bottom right corner, but this is an abstract design rather than a clear representation of an animal. I am very certain about my assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, I am at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
