{"id":"173457108","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features the text "CHAPPELLET" and a signature with "Molly Chappellet." There's also a symbol above the text, which appears to be a geometric logo or a stylized letter "A," but it is not representative of a human or animal. I'm very certain about this; on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
