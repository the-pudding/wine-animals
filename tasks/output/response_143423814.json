{"id":"143423814","responseA":"The image shows a wine label from "√Åster", a winery in the Ribera del Duero region of Spain. There are no animals or humans depicted on this label. The design includes a sketch of a building that could be the winery or estate itself, accompanied by a few trees. There is text that provides information about the wine, including its origin and some tasting notes or sentiments associated with the wine. I am very certain about this (1 on your scale), as the details are clearly presented in a typical format for a wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
