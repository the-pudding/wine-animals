{"id":"1969872","responseA":"The image shows a close-up of a wine bottle label which reads "Porto 10 Years SÃ£o Pedro Das Aguas". There appears to be a coat of arms or emblem, which might include an animal representation, but it is not clear enough to determine the details from this image. There are no human figures on the label. My certainty level regarding not seeing any specific animals or humans clearly would be close to 1, since the focus is on text and branding details rather than photographic or illustrative depictions of people or animals.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
