{"id":"150435732","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is for "Vi√±a Magna Tempranillo Crianza" from the Ribera del Duero denomination of origin. The design is quite elegant with what appears to be a stylized monogram or logo consisting of the letters 'V' and 'M' intertwined. I am very certain about this observation; on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
