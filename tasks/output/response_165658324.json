{"id":"165658324","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on the wine label. The label features the word "paixar" followed by "mencía," which likely refers to the Mencía grape variety used in the wine. There is also the number "13," which could potentially signify the year of the vintage or another significant number related to the wine or winery. The background of the label has a textured appearance, and there is an image of what appears to be a rock or mineral, which could symbolize the terroir or the environment where the grapes are grown.I am very certain that there are no animals or humans on the label, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
