{"id":"2202504","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. It seems to be a label for "Hidalgo Pedro Ximenez," which is a naturally sweet wine. The label mentions "Emilio Hidalgo," which is likely the name of the wine producer, and "Jerez - Xérès - Sherry," indicating the type and region associated with the wine. I am very certain there are no animals or humans depicted on this label; my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
