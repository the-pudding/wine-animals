{"id":"168636790","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "Clos des Confidences," indicating it is a Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru. The label design does not feature any discernible animals or humans; instead, it has a decorative element at the top that looks like a stylized emblem or crest. There are no realistic depictions of living creatures on this label. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
