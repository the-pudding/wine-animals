{"id":"171452884","responseA":"I can see an illustration that seems to depict a landscape with perhaps a small animal or plant life on the wine label. There are no human figures or discernible animal shapes that are detailed enough to be confident about their identification. My certainty about the content of the illustration is about 0.5 on the scale from 0 to 1 because the image is quite stylized and not detailed.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 0.5}"}
