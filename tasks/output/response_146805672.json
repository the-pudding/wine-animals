{"id":"146805672","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Kendall-Jackson Jackson Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Alexander Valley Hawkeye Mountain." There are no animals or humans depicted on this label. The design shows an emblem at the top, which appears to be a crest with a stylized image of what might be a grape cluster, indicative of the wine's connection to vineyards. The rest of the label features elegant text and a subtle graphic that resembles topographic lines of a mountain, likely representing the "Hawkeye Mountain" mentioned in the name. I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans visible on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
