{"id":"167326769","responseA":"Based on the image provided, the label has no animals or humans depicted on it. The label shows an illustration of a cigar box, which is associated with the name of the wine, "CIGAR BOX." The wine is described as an "Old Vine Malbec" and indicates that it is "Hand Harvested." There are no images of living creatures; the focus is entirely on the product branding and the type of wine. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
