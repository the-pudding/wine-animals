{"id":"162907143","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It's a text-based label that includes the name "Knights Bridge," the variety of wine, which is "Chardonnay," and the designation "Knights Valley." At the top, there is an emblem that appears to be a crest or coat of arms, but it does not include any images of animals or humans. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
