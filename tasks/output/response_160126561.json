{"id":"160126561","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with the name "CAVUS" and indicates it's from the Napa Valley, Stags Leap District. The label features an illustration of what appear to be two stylized representations of deer antlers with leaves, which could be interpreted as a reference to vegetation and possibly the "Stags Leap" name of the wine's origin. There are no humans or animals directly depicted, only graphic elements that suggest parts of an animal. Regarding the certainty of no actual animals or humans on the label, I am very certain, so on the scale, my answer would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
