{"id":"169933707","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle with a label that reads "VILLA SANDI PINOT GRIGIO VENETO" and indicates "Indicazione Geografica Tipica," which is an Italian wine quality label. The illustration on the label seems to depict a grand building with columns, possibly a villa, which reflects the name "Villa Sandi." Below the depiction of the building, there is a small coat of arms with the date "1622." There are no visible animals or humans on the label depicted in the image. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
