{"id":"162307513","responseA":"The image depicts an abstract pattern that could be interpreted in various ways. While some might see elements that could be interpreted as animals or humans, the abstract nature makes it ambiguous. On a scale from 0 to 1 regarding certainty, I would lean towards the lower end of the scale, around 0.2 or lower, because the image does not clearly represent any specific animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.2}"}
