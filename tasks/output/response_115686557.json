{"id":"115686557","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with the name "Vosne-Roman√©e Les Malconsorts." The label includes a coat of arms with a shield flanked by what appears to be ornamental designs and possibly a fleur-de-lis at the top, which is a stylized lily often associated with French heraldry. There are no animals or humans depicted on this label. I am certain at a level of 1 that there are no actual animals or human figures on the label, as the elements presented are heraldic and decorative in nature.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
