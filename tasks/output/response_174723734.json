{"id":"174723734","responseA":"Yes, there are humans depicted on this wine label. They are stylized illustrations, not real people, showing a group enjoying a meal or a gathering, with one central figure appearing to pour a drink while others cheer and raise their glasses. There is also what seems to be food on the table, and some characters are holding what may be considered party paraphernalia, like musical instruments. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0â€“1, my certainty would be 1. There are no real animals or humans, only illustrations.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
