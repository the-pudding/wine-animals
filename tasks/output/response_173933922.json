{"id":"173933922","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the name "FERRUM Albariño" from the Rías Baixas region. In the center, there appears to be the image of a coin with what looks like a profile of a human face on it. It is common for coins to feature the profile of a person, often a figure of historical significance or a ruler. Regarding the scale of certainty about the presence of a human depiction on the coin, my level of certainty would be 1 because the image on the coin is a conventional and well-recognized representation of a human profile.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
