{"id":"174976913","responseA":"The image appears to show a wine label titled "CHERRY HOUSE" that describes the product as "2019 Paso Robles Rose Wine." There is a graphic element that resembles a cherry with a stem, which is an artistic representation and does not depict any real animals or humans. I would say with a level of certainty of 1 (very certain) that there are no real animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
