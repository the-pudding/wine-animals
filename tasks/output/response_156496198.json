{"id":"156496198","responseA":"The wine label features a crest with what appears to be a stylized bird, possibly a phoenix or an eagle, which is a common heraldic symbol. I am very certain that this is a non-realistic depiction of an animal and not a real animal or human. Therefore, on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', I am at 1 for my certainty that this image includes a stylized animal symbol.","responseB":"{  "animal": "Bird",  "certainty": 1}"}
