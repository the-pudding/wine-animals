{"id":"169225567","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to depict a stylized scene with human figures among grapevines, possibly representing the harvesting or tending to wine grapes. The style of the artwork is figurative and somewhat abstract. I am certain that there are human figures on the label (1.0 on the certainty scale), although they are depicted in an artistic and non-realistic manner. There do not seem to be any animals depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
