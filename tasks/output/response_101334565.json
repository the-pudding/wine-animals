{"id":"101334565","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with a depiction of a building which appears to be a ch√¢teau or estate, indicating the origin or style of the wine. Above the representation of the building, there is a decorative element that includes the face of what might be interpreted as Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, within a sunburst pattern. There aren't any real human figures or animals on the label. I am very certain of my interpretation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
