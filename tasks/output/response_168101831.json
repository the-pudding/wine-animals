{"id":"168101831","responseA":"The image displays a wine label that reads "PURSUIT Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley." The label features a landscape with a small group of people on horseback in the distance. Based on the context and the visual information, I can confirm there are human figures depicted on the label, and I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1. There are no clearly discernible animals apart from the horses that the people appear to be riding, but these are not separate animal figures, rather part of the scene with the human figures.","responseB":"{"animal": "human, horse","certainty": 1}"}
