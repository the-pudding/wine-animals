{"id":"162906649","responseA":"There is a small image of an animal on the label, located towards the bottom. It appears to be a stylized drawing of an animal, possibly a deer or a similar type of creature given its silhouette and the presence of antlers. I am about 0.9 certain that it represents an animal, considering the stylization and placement that is typical for animal imagery on product labels. There are no humans depicted on this wine label.","responseB":"{  "animal": "deer",  "certainty": 0.9}"}
