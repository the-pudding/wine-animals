{"id":"175677982","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on the wine label in the image. It features text that describes the wine, such as "50Â° Riesling" and "Trocken," which indicates it's a dry Riesling from the Rheingau region in Germany. The label also includes a graphic representation of what appears to be a globe or a map. I am very certain of my assessment, so I would rate it a 1 on the certainty scale.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
