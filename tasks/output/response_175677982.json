{"id":"175677982","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. There is text that reads "50Â° RIESLING" and "TROCKEN" along with "RHEINGAU - GERMANY," which indicates that the wine is a Riesling from the Rheingau region in Germany, and "trocken" denotes that the wine is dry. There's also a graphic of a globe with latitude lines, likely referencing the 50-degree latitude which corresponds with the Rheingau region. I am very certain (1) that there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
