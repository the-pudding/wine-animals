{"id":"160216082","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle labeled "AUDAX" from the Napa Valley, and it appears to be estate bottled. There is an emblem with a profile of what looks like a classical figure or face surrounded by a wreath of leaves. There are no animals or humans depicted in a real-life sense; the emblem's profile has a stylized, artistic representation of a face. I am certain (1 out of 1) that there are no real humans or animals in this image, only the artistic rendering on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
