{"id":"27095040","responseA":"I do not detect any animals or humans on this wine label. It features an illustration of a building, which appears to be a manor or estate, surrounded by a landscape that is likely a representation of vineyards. This would be consistent with the product being a wine, as vineyard landscapes are common on wine labels. I am very certain of this observation, so on the scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
