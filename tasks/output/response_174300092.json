{"id":"174300092","responseA":"The image displays a bottle of wine with a label that features an illustration. The illustration is somewhat intricate and whimsical, depicting what seems to be a room full of different objects and potentially animals. There appear to be no human figures on the label, but there is a bird flying on the right side of the label, close to a window.On a scale from 0 to 1 on how certain I am about the presence of animals but not humans, I would say 1 â€“ very certain that there is an animal (a bird) and no humans depicted on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
