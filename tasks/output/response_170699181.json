{"id":"170699181","responseA":"Based on the image provided, I do not see any animals or humans on it. It is a label for what appears to be a bottle of Albariño wine from Fillaboa, indicating the Rías Baixas Denominación de Origen (D.O.) which is a wine region in Spain known for its white wines made from the Albariño grape. The label also shows a coat of arms or crest, which is a common decorative element on wine labels but does not depict any animals or humans. I am very certain about my observation; I would rate it as 1 on the scale of certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
