{"id":"165213594","responseA":"The image depicts a bottle of wine with a label that reads "EMPORIUM" at the top. There is a small emblem above the name that appears to be an animal, possibly a lion or a crest with an animal on it, which is common in heraldic symbols or logos but it is too small to accurately discern its details. Based on the visible features, I am about 0.7 certain that there is an animal emblem on the label. There are no humans visible on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion","certainty": 0.7}"}
