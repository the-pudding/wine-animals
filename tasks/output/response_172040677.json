{"id":"172040677","responseA":"The image features a wine label with the words "Knuttel Family - Russian River Valley - Chardonnay - Kate's Pas de Deux". The upper part of the label has a sepia-tone photograph of a person's lower legs and feet, one of which is en pointe, suggestive of ballet dancing. There are no full images of humans or animals present, just the partial view of human legs/feet in a dancing position. I am very certain of this, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
