{"id":"174578812","responseA":"The image features an artistic representation of a bear riding a unicycle, which is part of the design of the wine label. The label reads "d'Orsaria PINOT GRIGIO Italia," indicating that the wine is an Italian Pinot Grigio. There are no humans or real animals in this image, only an illustrated character of a bear. I am certain about my observation (1.0 on your specified scale).","responseB":"{  "animal": "bear",  "certainty": 1}"}
