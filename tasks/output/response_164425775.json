{"id":"164425775","responseA":"The image shows a wine label from "Lemelson Vineyards," specifically for a Reserve Chardonnay wine from the Willamette Valley. The label features an illustrated landscape of vineyard terrain with rolling hills and rows of grapevines, and there's a building that resembles a house or winery facility in the illustration. There are no visible animals or humans on this labelâ€”it is purely a depiction of a vineyard landscape. I am very certain about my observation, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
