{"id":"4402293","responseA":"I can see that the image includes what appears to be a sculpture of a winged humanoid figure featured on the wine label. This is not a real person or an animal but an artistic depiction of a figure, which is identified as "Winged Woman Walking" sculpture by Stephen de Staebler. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1, very certain.","responseB":"{  "animal": "Winged Woman Walking",  "certainty": 1}"}
