{"id":"171761685","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the name "Domaine Corne-Loup LIRAC." The label features a small emblem that depicts a figure that appears to be a person riding an animal which could be a wolf, given the name "Corne-Loup" (which translates to "Horn-wolf" in French). On a scale from 0 to 1, I am very certain that there is an illustration of both a human and an animal on the label, so my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human and wolf","certainty": 1}"}
