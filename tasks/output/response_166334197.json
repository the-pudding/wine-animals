{"id":"166334197","responseA":"This image features the label of a wine bottle. The label has a stylized tree with what appears to be a human figure integrated into the trunk. The presence of human or animal elements seems to be a part of the artistic design of the label, intending to convey a type of connection to nature or a personification of the tree. I am certain that the figure on the label is intended to represent a human form as part of the tree's design, so on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 is 'very certain', I would rate my certainty as 1. However, it is important to note that this is an artistic depiction and not a real human.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1.0}"}
