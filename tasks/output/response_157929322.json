{"id":"157929322","responseA":"Yes, there is an illustration of a human on the wine label. It depicts a person from behind, who appears to be walking or strolling leisurely, which matches the term "Fl√¢neur" on the label, which refers to a leisurely wanderer in French. There is also a small illustration that appears to be a butterfly or moth on the lower left side of the label. I am very certain about these observations, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human, butterfly or moth",  "certainty": 1}"}
