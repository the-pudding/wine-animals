{"id":"156101231","responseA":"There are no humans on the wine label, but there is an image of what looks like a small horse or a similar creature. Given that labels often include stylized representations, it's my assessment that this is a highly stylized or decorative representation rather than a lifelike depiction of an animal. On a scale of 0-1 where 0 is 'not certain at all' and 1 is 'very certain', I am 1 (very certain) that there are no real animals or humans on this label, just graphic representations.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse", "certainty": 1}"}
