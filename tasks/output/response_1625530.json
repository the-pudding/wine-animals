Above the text, there appears to be a small graphic or icon that resembles a coat of arms or a crest, including a depiction of a lion. There are no humans depicted or any realistic depictions of animals on this label. I am very certain about this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
