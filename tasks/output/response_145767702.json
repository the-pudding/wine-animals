{"id":"145767702","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "FINCA NUEVA RESERVA RIOJA DENOMINACIÃ“N DE ORIGEN CALIFICADA." There is an animal depicted on the label; it appears to be a bird in flight due to the shape of the wings and body. There are no humans or other types of animals visible on the label. I am very certain about the presence of the bird illustration, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
