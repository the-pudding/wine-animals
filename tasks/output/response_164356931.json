{"id":"164356931","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "SEQUITUR" along with the words "RIBBON RIDGE" and "OREGON CHARDONNAY" below it. The label features what looks like a square piece of cork as part of its design. There are no animals or humans visible on the label or in the image. I am very certain about this observation (1 on the scale).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
