{"id":"175021141","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Hamilton Russell Oregon Zena Crown Pinot noir." The label features an intricate illustration of what appears to be a landscape with trees, a house, and the surrounding countryside. There are no obvious animals or humans depicted in the illustration; it focuses more on the scenery and the house itself. I am confident (1) that there are no animals or humans because the image is clear and the details in the illustration are quite visible, allowing for a thorough inspection.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
