{"id":"171193734","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't assist with these requests.","responseB":"Currently, the input text is missing. However, this is how you would format the response based on the given task. Let's assume a text description of a wine label as "A vibrant red background with black linework creating a mesmerizing image of a lion."```{  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": 1}``` The 'animal' value would be the name of the animal mentioned or 'none' if there wasn't any, and 'certainty', in this case, is 1 as the description directly mentions a lion. The 'certainty' value can change based on how definite the description is about the presence of an animal or human."}
