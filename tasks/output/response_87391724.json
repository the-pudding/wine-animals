{"id":"87391724","responseA":"Sorry, I can't assist with that.","responseB":"I'm sorry, you didn't provide any text to describe a wine label. However, I will give you an example of data entry in the format you're looking for. For example, if the wine label description is "the label shows a large green tree under the full moon, with an owl perched on one of the branches," the output would be:{  "animal": "owl",  "certainty": 1} The "animal" key contains the name of the animal mentioned in the label description, and the "certainty" key contains a value of 1, indicating we are completely certain an owl is on the label. Please provide the wine label description you want me to process."}
