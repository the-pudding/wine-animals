{"id":"163605506","responseA":"The image is indeed a wine label for Marston Family Vineyard's 2011 Albion wine. There are no animals or humans depicted on the label; it features a stylized design with the letters "M" and "V" interlaced, likely representing the initials of Marston Family Vineyard. I am very certain of this interpretation, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
