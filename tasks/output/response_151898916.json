{"id":"151898916","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features a graphic that includes what seems to be a stylized anchor and crossed objects, possibly representing winemaking equipment, within a circular boundary. Below this graphic, the text reads "Kalkspitz," which is likely the name of the wine, followed by additional information that might refer to the wine's specifications or classification. The word "Ã–sterreich" indicates that the wine is from Austria. I am very certain there are no animals or humans in this image. My certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
