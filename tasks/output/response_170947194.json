{"id":"170947194","responseA":"I see an insect depicted on the label of this wine bottle, specifically, it looks like a stylized image of a cricket (grillon in French), which seems apt as the name of the wine is "Le Champ des Grillons." There are no human images or any other animals visible on the label. I am very certain of this observation, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "cricket",  "certainty": 1}"}
