{"id":"168390700","responseA":"The label shows a small circular logo near the top that features what appears to be a sheep, and below this is text. The main part of the label has the name "GABRIËLSKLOOF" followed by "ROSEBUD," which indicates the variety or name of the wine. Below, there's a line sketch of what seems to be a rural estate or vineyard. The background color suggests that this might be a rosé wine, which is consistent with the "Rosebud" name. There is no clear depiction of humans on the label. My certainty level regarding the absence of human depictions on this label is 1, meaning I am very certain. I am also very certain, with a level of 1, that there is an animal depicted in the logo, which is a stylized representation of a sheep.","responseB":"{"animal": "sheep","certainty": 1}"}
