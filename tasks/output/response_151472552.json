{"id":"151472552","responseA":"The label appears to feature an abstract design that might suggest the theme of a volcano, given the name "PROFUMO DI VULCANO". The design does not clearly depict any animals or humans; instead, it looks like an artistic representation of colors and shapes that may represent flowing lava or volcanic activity. I am very certain, rating it a 1, that there are no distinct animals or humans illustrated on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
