{"id":"2832125","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features the text "Jacquelynn" prominently at the center, which is likely the brand name, and "Cabernet Sauvignon," indicating the type of wine. The label also mentions "Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Oakville, Napa Valley," pointing to the origin of the wine. It is adorned with a simple but elegant vine illustration. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being 'not certain at all' and 1 being 'very certain', my certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
