{"id":"3996630","responseA":"There are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The label features a crest with various heraldic symbols, including a key, a crown, and what appears to be a bishop's mitre, which is associated with the historical figure the wine is named after (Pape Cl√©ment). I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
