{"id":"172746320","responseA":"In the image, there are no clear depictions of animals or humans on the wine label. The label features the text "Bella Sera," "Product of Italy," "Veneto," and "Pinot Grigio," along with a picture of a building that appears to be a large house or perhaps a villa. The background seems to depict a night scene, with what might be stars or lights in the sky. I am certain at a level of 1 that there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
