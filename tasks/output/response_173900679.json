{"id":"173900679","responseA":"It appears that there are no animals or humans on this wine label. The label contains the text "KB," "Knights Bridge Estate," and "Cabernet Sauvignon 2018 Knights Valley," along with an intricate graphic design that seems to represent a crest or a portion of a coat of arms. There is no clear depiction of an animal or human in the part of the image we can see. I would say with a certainty of 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
