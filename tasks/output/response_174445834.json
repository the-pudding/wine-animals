{"id":"174445834","responseA":"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with this request.","responseB":"To provide a relevant response, it is necessary to receive a text that describes a wine label. Only after evaluating this information can I accurately determine the details of any animal or human figures present and offer a degree of certainty for the evaluation. Here's an example of the expected output in JSON format, assuming there is a lion on the wine label and I am 100% sure of it:```{  "animal": "lion",  "certainty": 1}``` Without the describing text, both values would be assigned as follows:```{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 0}``` Please provide the necessary description to continue."}
