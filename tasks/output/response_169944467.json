{"id":"169944467","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that appears to feature an abstract or stylized design. It's not a clear depiction of any specific animal or human. Based on the abstract nature of the design, I would say I am 1 (very certain) that there's no explicit representation of real animals or humans. However, since it's a matter of interpretation, someone else might see the shapes differently.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
