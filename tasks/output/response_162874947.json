{"id":"162874947","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that does not feature any animals or humans. It appears to be a label for a Swiss red wine, specifically a "DÃ´le des Monts" by Robert Gilliard. On a scale of certainty regarding the absence of animals or humans in the image, I would say 1, as there are no such figures depicted on the label visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
