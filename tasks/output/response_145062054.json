{"id":"145062054","responseA":"The image displays a wine label for "Vino Nobile di Montepulciano". The label is quite decorative with a central emblem that features a human profile within a crest or medallion, surrounded by floral patterns. There does not appear to be any animals on this label. I am 1 (very certain) that the profile of a human is present in the label's design.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
