{"id":"163902102","responseA":"I can confirm that there are no animals or humans on this wine label.

However, they are stylized representations and not actual animals or humans. I am very certain about this assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
