{"id":"19180142","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the brand name "PRICUM" prominently at the top and "Valdemuz" written below. It indicates that the wine has an appellation of origin from "Tierra de Le√≥n." There is a drawn element on the label that appears to be a leaf, but there are no animals or humans depicted on this label. I am very certain about this assessment, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
