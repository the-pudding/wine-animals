There is a small icon of a classical building or monument on top, which is part of the brand's logo, and the year 1662, which may represent the founding year or another significant date in the history of the winery.There are no animals or humans visible on the label. I am very certain of this observation (1 on the scale of certainty).","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
