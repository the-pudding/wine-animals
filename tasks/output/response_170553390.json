{"id":"170553390","responseA":"In the image, there's a crest or emblem at the top of the wine label. Within this emblem, there appears to be an illustration of a creature with wings; this could be interpreted as a stylized animal, possibly a mythological bird or similar figure. It's an artistic depiction that is part of the ornate design often found on such labels.On the scale of certainty regarding whether there's an animal on the wine label, considering it is a stylized representation and part of the emblem, I would say 1, because I am very certain that the emblem depicts an artistic rendition of an animal-like figure. However, please note that such depictions on labels are often symbolic and not meant to represent real animals.","responseB":"{"animal": "mythological bird", "certainty": 1}"}
