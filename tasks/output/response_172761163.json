It is a "Grand Vin de Bourgogne," indicating that it is a high-quality wine from the Burgundy region in France. The label also specifies "Appellation Maranges Contrôlée" and the vintage "2017". It mentions "Vieilles Vignes" as well, suggesting the wine was made from old vines, which often contribute to more concentrated flavors in the wine.There are no animals or humans on the label; the only graphic is a stylized sun or flower-like symbol above the text. I am very certain (1 on the provided scale) that no animals or humans are depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
