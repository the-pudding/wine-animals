{"id":"165364828","responseA":"The image depicts a wine bottle label for "LEVANTE." The label does have a small graphic that resembles a stylized bird; it appears to be made from a simplified, decorative form with a grape cluster next to it. My certainty level that this is a graphic representation of a bird alongside a cluster of grapes is 1, meaning I am very certain of this observation. There are no real animals or humans visible in this image.","responseB":"{  "animal": "bird",  "certainty": 1}"}
