{"id":"173198982","responseA":"I can see an emblem that resembles a crest or shield on the wine label, which might be interpreted as featuring an animal or a symbol. However, it is not distinctly clear if it is an animal or a purely decorative element since the image is small and the details are not fully visible. My certainty about the presence of an animal on this label is therefore not absolute, so I would say on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be around 0.5.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
