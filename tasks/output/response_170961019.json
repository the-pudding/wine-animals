{"id":"170961019","responseA":"The image displays a wine label with the name "BUTTER BLOCK Chardonnay Santa Maria Valley." There is a small graphical element at the top of the hexagonal label that appears to be two entities interacting, but it's not clear enough to confidently determine whether they are animals, humans, or simply a decorative design. I would say on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty about the presence of animals or humans in the graphic is roughly 0.5, as it is ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways without additional context or detail.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0.5}"}
