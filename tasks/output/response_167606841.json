{"id":"167606841","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle label that features the brand name "MANU" with the subtitle "Wine of New Zealand." Below that, it indicates the wine type as "Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc." There is a stylized representation of a bird, which appears to be a form of silhouette or emblem, at the top of the label. This is not a real animal but rather a design element of the label. I am certain that there are no actual animals or humans in this image (1 out of 1 for certainty).","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
