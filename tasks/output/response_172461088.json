{"id":"172461088","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle label with the name "EFUSIVO IGP AÇORES" prominently featured. The label's background appears to have an abstract design, with no clear depiction of animals or humans. There seem to be patterns that may resemble topographical lines or flows, possibly reflecting volcanic activity, which could be associated with the Azores, as suggested by "AÇORES" on the label. I am very certain (1) that there are no explicit images of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
