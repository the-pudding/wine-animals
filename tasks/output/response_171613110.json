{"id":"171613110","responseA":"This is an image of a wine bottle label which reads "ZIEREISEN" at the top and "Blauer Spätburgunder" at the bottom, indicating the wine brand and the type which seems to be a Pinot Noir as "Spätburgunder" is the German term for this variety. The label contains a small, monochromatic picture that appears to include people. My certainty level for the presence of people in the small picture on the label is 1, as it is clear despite the small size.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
