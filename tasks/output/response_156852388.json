{"id":"156852388","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for a bottle of Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru, "Les Suchots," from Domaine René Cacheux & Fils. The label features a shield emblem that appears to be a heraldic crest, but there do not seem to be any animals or humans on the label. My certainty is 1, as I am very confident in describing what is visible in the provided image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
