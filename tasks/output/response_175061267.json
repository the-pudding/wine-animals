{"id":"175061267","responseA":"The image appears to be taken in a low-light setting and is blurry, which makes it difficult to identify details with precision. The label displays text that reads "Sancerre" which indicates the type of wine, and "2022 Eric Cottat" which suggests the vintage and potentially the name of the vintner or wine producer.There are no visible animals or humans on the label. Given the quality and clarity of the image, I cannot be certain about finer details. My certainty level for not seeing any animals or humans on the label in this particular image is 1, as the label seems to consist solely of text with no graphical elements discernible.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
