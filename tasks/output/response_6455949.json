{"id":"6455949","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to be a stylized representation of a human, specifically a figure who seems to be holding a hammer and set within a circular frame with letters around it. I cannot see any animals depicted on the label. My certainty level that the figure represents a human is 1, as it's clear that the design intends to represent a person.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
