{"id":"164361228","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label features the name "MOMO," indicating the brand, and it specifies that the wine is a Pinot Noir from Marlborough, New Zealand, and that it is organic. The design is simple with text and a small graphic element that resembles a flower above the "O" in "MOMO," but no animals or humans are depicted. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
