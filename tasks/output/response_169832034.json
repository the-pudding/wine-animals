{"id":"169832034","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that reads "RAYOS UVA" at the top, along with other text such as "VENDIMIA SELECCIONADA," "VINO TINTO," "PRODUCTO DE ESPAÑA," and "RIOJA Denominación de Origen Calificada." There are no visible animals or humans on the label. This is just a graphic design typically found on a wine bottle. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
