{"id":"160243557","responseA":"The image shows a label on a wine bottle, specifically from "Chateau Rocher-Figeac Saint-Ã‰milion". There are no animals or humans visible on the label. It features text and what appears to be a drawing or photograph of a building, likely the chateau itself. I am very certain, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
