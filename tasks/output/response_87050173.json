{"id":"87050173","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the name "COTO DE IMAZ RESERVA". It's from the Rioja region, as indicated by the "DENOMINACIÓN DE ORIGEN CALIFICADA RIOJA" mention on the label. The label features a detailed illustration that appears to be a countryside estate or vineyard, which is typical of wine labels as they often reference the origin of the wine. Below the illustration, there is some text in Spanish, and at the bottom, there is a coat of arms or crest above the word "IMAZ" and the term "RESERVA".There are no clear images of humans or animals on this section of the label; it's more focused on the scenery and details pertaining to the wine itself. My level of certainty regarding the absence of animals or humans in this image is 1 – very certain – based on the visible content provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
