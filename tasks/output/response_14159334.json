{"id":"14159334","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle label for "Vignali Roccamora" with a coat of arms that includes a shield and a crest. There appears to be a lion depicted within the crest at the top of the shield, representing an animal commonly used in heraldry. I am very certain of this observation, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1. There are no humans visible on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 1}"}
