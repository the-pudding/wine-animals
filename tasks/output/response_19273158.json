{"id":"19273158","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans in this image. It is a label for a bottle of wine, specifically Pinot Noir by John Belsham from Marlborough, as part of the Belsham Vineyard Selections. The word "FOX" is prominently displayed on the label, but there is no literal depiction of a fox or any other creature. I am certain about this, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
