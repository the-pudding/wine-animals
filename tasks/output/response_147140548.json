{"id":"147140548","responseA":"On the label, there is an illustration that includes a building that appears to be a chateau or estate, with a detailed facade and trees on either side. Above the illustration of the building, there is an embellishment that could be interpreted as a mask or face-like element, but this is decorative and does not represent a real animal or human. There is no clear depiction of any animals or humans on this wine label. I am fairly certain of this assessment, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
