{"id":"157199927","responseA":"The wine label features two animals that are stylized as lions. They are on either side of a coat of arms, which is a common design element for many European wine labels to convey heritage and quality. They are not real lions but rather artistic renderings or symbols. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain of my analysis of the image.","responseB":"{  "animal": "lions",  "certainty": 1}"}
