{"id":"148537627","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Fongoli Decius Montefalco Sagrantino Passito". At the top of the label, there is a coat of arms-like emblem, and inside this emblem, there appears to be a depiction of creatures that could be either fantastical or real animalsâ€”most likely lions or some kind of heraldic beasts typically found in such crests. However, due to the small size and stylization, I'd only be moderately certain about their exact identity. On a scale from 0 to 1, I would say my certainty is around 0.7. There are no human figures visible on the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "lions or heraldic beasts", "certainty": 0.7}"}
