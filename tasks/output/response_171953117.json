{"id":"171953117","responseA":"This image depicts a wine label from Robert Foley Vineyards, specifically for a Chardonnay from Napa Valley. There is an emblem of a mythical creature that resembles a griffin, which is a legendary creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. This is an animal figure, but it is not a real animal; it's a figure from mythology. I am very certain about my interpretation of the image, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "griffin",  "certainty": 1}"}
