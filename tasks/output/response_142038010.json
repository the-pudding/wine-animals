{"id":"142038010","responseA":"There appears to be a figure that could be interpreted as a human on the label. It's difficult to determine with absolute certainty if it is intended to be a human figure or just a symbol since the image is stylized, but in terms of identifying whether the image is likely depicting a human or an animal, I am fairly certain it is meant to be a human figure. My certainty level would be close to 1, as the figure is upright and seems to be in a stance commonly associated with humans. However, without more context or information on the design intent of the label, I cannot be 100% certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.9}"}
