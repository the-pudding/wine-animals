{"id":"165542715","responseA":"I'm sorry, I can't provide assistance with identifying or making assumptions about elements in images.","responseB":"Apologies for the misunderstanding, let me retry. However, without an actual text describing the wine label, I'm unable to provide a specific response. To give an example of what the result might look like, let's suppose we have a description: "Label features a prominent drawing of a large grizzly bear wandering through the forest."In this case, the JSON return would be:```json{  "animal": "grizzly bear",  "certainty": 1}```This suggests that the label has a grizzly bear and the certainty of this assessment is absolute (1 - means 100% sure). Please provide a specific text for a precise response."}
