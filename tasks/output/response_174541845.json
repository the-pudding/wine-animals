{"id":"174541845","responseA":"Yes, the image on the label shows a human figure and a group of sheep. The human is depicted as a caricature, standing with a sheepdog and a staff, dressed in what appears to be pastoral or shepherd attire, including a hat. Behind the human figure, there are several sheep, suggesting a pastoral or agricultural theme often associated with the rustic origins of wine. I am very certain about the depiction of the human figure and animals on this label, so my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human, sheep, sheepdog",  "certainty": 1}"}
