{"id":"145509581","responseA":"The image you've provided is a close-up of a wine bottle label from Leeuwin Estate, specifically the Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay from Margaret River. There do not appear to be any animals or humans depicted on this section of the label. The design is quite clean and focuses on text with some graphic elements, including what appears to be a musical score or musical notation at the bottom, which is more artistic than representational.As for certainty, given the clear image, I'm 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans on this visible part of the label. However, if there were elements wrapping around the bottle that are not visible here, I cannot speak for those.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
