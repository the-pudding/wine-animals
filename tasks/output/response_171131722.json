{"id":"171131722","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "SAINT HENRI Vin de Pays d'Oc Doux." While the central element of the label design incorporates what appears to be a stylized circular logo or emblem, there does not appear to be a clear depiction of animals or humans within this emblem or elsewhere on the label. The emblem consists of various ornamental elements which do not clearly form recognizable figures of animals or humans. Based on the image, I would rate my certainty as 1 that there are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
