{"id":"170565310","responseA":"The image shows a bottle with a wine label that reads "Vin Rosé" indicating that it's a type of rosé wine from France. There are no clear images of animals or humans on the label. It consists mostly of text and decorative elements that resemble grapevines or grape clusters, which is a common motif for wine labels. I am very certain (1) of my observation as there are no distinct figures that resemble animals or humans visible.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
