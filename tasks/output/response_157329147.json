{"id":"157329147","responseA":"Yes, there is an illustration of a human on the wine label.

The figure is shown gesturing towards a levitating barrel, which plays on the name of the wine, "Levitation." I am very certain (1) that the image depicts a human figure as part of its design.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
