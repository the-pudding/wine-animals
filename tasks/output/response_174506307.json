{"id":"174506307","responseA":"The label features an emblem or symbol that looks like an animal figure, possibly a bird, given its shape and the way it is stylistically represented with wings. I'm about 0.9 certain that there's an animal representation on the label, but it's a stylized graphic representation rather than a real animal. No humans are depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 0.9}"}
