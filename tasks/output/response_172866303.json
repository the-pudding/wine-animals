{"id":"172866303","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features text that reads "Acrobat," which is presumably the brand name, and "Ros√© of Pinot Noir, Oregon," which describes the type of wine and its origin. The label has a clean and simple design with no illustrations of animals or humans. My certainty level is 1, meaning I am very certain of my observations.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
