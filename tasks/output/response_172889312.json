{"id":"172889312","responseA":"In the image provided, there is a wine label for a wine named "Mâcon" from the year 2015, by Bourcier-Martinot. It has the designation "Appellation Mâcon Contrôlée." There are faint decorations in the background, which could potentially be interpreted as floral or vine motifs, but there is no clear depiction of any animal or human figures visible on the portion of the label we can see. Without seeing the entire label, it's difficult to provide a certainty level about the absence of animals or human figures elsewhere on the label.I'm unable to analytically predict what might not be shown in this image. However, based on the portion visible, I would say with high certainty, close to 1, that there are no animals or humans depicted in this specific portion of the label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
