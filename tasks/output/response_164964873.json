{"id":"164964873","responseA":"There are no animals or humans visible on this wine label. It features the brand name "RAVINES" and the type of wine, which is "Dry Riesling" from the Finger Lakes region, along with other details like the alcohol content. The illustration seems to depict a rural scene with a building but no discernible animals or humans. I am very certain about this assessment, so on a scale of 0 to 1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
