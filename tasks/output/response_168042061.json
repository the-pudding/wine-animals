{"id":"168042061","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "VILLA CALCINAIA". Below that, it appears to say "Mauvais Chapon" and indicates that the wine is a "Rosato Metodo Classico Brut." There is an illustration of humans on the label, depicted in an old-fashioned, possibly historical style. As for certainty, I would rate it 1, being very certain that there are illustrations of humans on the label. I am unable to visually identify any animals within this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
