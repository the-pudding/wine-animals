{"id":"160129349","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. It contains text that mentions "Napa Valley," "Cabernet Sauvignon," and "Bernard Magrez," which is likely associated with the brand or producer of the wine. There's also a logo at the bottom, which includes a design of crossed keys. I am very certain of my observations, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
