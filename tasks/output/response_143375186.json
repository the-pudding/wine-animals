{"id":"143375186","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that reads "Château du Coing de St Fiacre Comte de Saint Hubert Vieilles Vignes Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Sur Lie." The image on the label appears to be a drawing of a château, which is a type of large French country house or castle, often associated with vineyards in wine-producing regions. There are no animals or humans visible in the image depicted on the wine label. I am very certain of this assessment, so I would rate my certainty as 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
