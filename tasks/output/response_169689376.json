{"id":"169689376","responseA":"The image features a label from a bottle of wine. On the label, there is a graphic representation of a person and a bull. The depiction seems to illustrate a person, likely a matador, in a pose that suggests they're engaging with the bull in a bullfighting scene. My certainty level about the presence of these figures is 1, as the artwork is clear and distinct.","responseB":"{  "animal": "bull, human",  "certainty": 1}"}
