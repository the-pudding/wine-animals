{"id":"172455273","responseA":"There is an abstract representation or design that resembles a stylized animal on this wine label. Specifically, the design could be interpreted as some sort of bird due to the way the shape curves into what appears to be a head and beak. However, there are no clear images of actual animals or humans. My certainty level is 1 that I'm interpreting the image correctly as there are no realistic depictions of animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 1}"}
