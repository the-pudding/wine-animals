{"id":"168659805","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle label, from the Yarra Valley region, specifically a "Giant Steps Applejack Vineyard Chardonnay".

My certainty in this determination is essentially 0, as the graphic is stylized and lacks detail.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 0}"}
