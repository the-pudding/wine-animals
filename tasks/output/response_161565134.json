{"id":"161565134","responseA":"On the wine label, there is an emblem that appears to feature a stylized animal as part of its design, which looks like it might be a lion based on the shape of the head and mane, as is common in heraldic imagery. However, it is not a photograph of a real animal but rather a graphic or illustration. Regarding certainty, without a higher resolution or closer detail, it's challenging to give a precise scale rating, but based on the typical style of such emblems, I would say there is a high degree of certainty—around 0.9—that the image intends to represent an animal, likely a lion, within the emblem's design.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion", "certainty": 0.9}"}
