{"id":"172545888","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to be a stylized graphic that might be interpreted as an abstract form of an animal, particularly because there is a shape that resembles an eye. However, there are no clear depictions of actual animals or humans on this labelâ€”it more closely resembles artistic embellishments or decorations. I would say with a certainty of 1 that there are no detailed or realistic depictions of animals or humans on this wine label.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
