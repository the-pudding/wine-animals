{"id":"156218696","responseA":"The image presents a label from a wine bottle for Chateau Haut-Marbuzet, indicating it's likely a French wine (the text suggests a Bordeaux origin). The label features a drawing of a chateau, which is likely the winery or estate associated with the wine. There are no animals or humans depicted in the drawing; it's an architectural illustration only. I am 1 (very certain) that there are no animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
