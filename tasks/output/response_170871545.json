{"id":"170871545","responseA":"On the wine label, there are illustrations of two lions, one on either side of a shield that seems to have a crown on top. These animals are part of the label's design, likely symbolizing nobility or strength, which are common themes in heraldry. My certainty level in identifying these illustrated animals on the wine label is 1 (very certain).","responseB":"{"animal": "lions","certainty": 1}"}
