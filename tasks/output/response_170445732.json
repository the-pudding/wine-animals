{"id":"170445732","responseA":"The image shows an abstract design on a wine label that could be interpreted in multiple ways.

Given the abstract nature of the design, I would say with a certainty of 1 that there are no clear representations of animals or humans identifiable in the image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
