{"id":"16198079","responseA":"In the image, there are no animals or humans depicted on the wine label. The label showcases a crest or coat of arms featuring heraldic elements such as a shield, a crown, and possibly some stylized decorations that could be interpreted as abstract animal elements, but there is no clear representation of an actual animal or human. I am very certain of this assessment, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
