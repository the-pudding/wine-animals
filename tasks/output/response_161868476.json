{"id":"161868476","responseA":"The image shows a wine bottle with a label that reads "TorCalvano Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita". In the center of the label is a logo that features what appears to be a stylized animal, possibly a horse or a dragon, inside a crest or shield. Given the context and the appearance, it is an emblem or symbol often used to represent a winery or a vineyard's branding. I am certain of the contents of the image I described, so I would say my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse or dragon","certainty": 1}"}
