{"id":"174390636","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for "Musigny Blanc" which is classified as a Grand Cru from the appellation Musigny in Burgundy, France. The label indicates that it is a product of Domaine Comte Georges de Vogüé from Chambolle-Musigny, Côte-d'Or. On the label, there is a coat of arms featuring a heraldic animal which resembles a bird, likely a rooster or a similar fowl. I am very certain, so I would say 1 on the scale, that this is a graphical representation of an animal and not a photo of a real animal. Since it's part of a coat of arms design, this depiction of the animal is symbolic and typical for heraldic imagery.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird", "certainty": 1}"}
