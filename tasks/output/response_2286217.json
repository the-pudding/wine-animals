{"id":"2286217","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label for "Château Canon," a 1er (premier) Grand Cru Classé wine from Saint-Émilion Grand Cru. The label features an illustration of what appears to be a vineyard with rows of grapevines leading to a building, likely the chateau itself. I do not see any clear images of humans or animals on the label. My certainty level is 1, as I am very sure of my assessment of the image presented.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
