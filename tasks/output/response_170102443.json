{"id":"170102443","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. It features the text "Spring Vouvray," indicating the name of the wine or the winery, as well as "Appellation Vouvray Contrôlée" and "Chenin Blanc," which refers to the type of wine and grape variety. The image on the label appears to be an abstract design rather than a depiction of any living creature. I am very certain about this observation, so on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being 'very certain', my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
