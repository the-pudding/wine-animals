{"id":"170898888","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to be an abstract representation of a scene, possibly a cityscape or urban setting. There are shapes that might suggest buildings and possibly figures that could be interpreted as humans in a very stylized form, but they are not detailed and it's not certain that they are meant to depict people. Due to the abstract nature of the image, it is difficult to definitively identify animals or humans. On a scale of 0-1 for certainty, I would say 0.5â€”it's ambiguous.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 0.5}"}
