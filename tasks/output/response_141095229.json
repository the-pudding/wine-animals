{"id":"141095229","responseA":"The image is of a wine bottle label for "Ménage à Trois Prosecco." There are no animals or humans depicted in a realistic or photographic sense on this label. However, the label does feature a stylized illustration of two human-like figures that are dancing or jumping. Since these figures are part of the brand's logo and are artistically rendered rather than being depictions of specific individuals, my level of certainty that they represent humans but not any specific individual is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human","certainty": 1}"}
