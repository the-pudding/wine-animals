{"id":"3332005","responseA":"The image shows a label from a bottle of "Arcadian - Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir, Santa Lucia Highlands." There is an emblem or crest at the top of the label, which features an animal that appears to be a deer or similar creature. I cannot see any humans on the label. I am very certain that the image depicts a wine label and has an animal represented in the emblem, so on a scale of 0-1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "deer", "certainty": 1}"}
