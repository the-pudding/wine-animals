{"id":"164977005","responseA":"The image displays a wine label, specifically for Barolo wine, produced by the Massucco winery. On the label, there are graphic elements that resemble a coat of arms, including what appears to be a crest with a helmet, mantling (the decorative fabric around the helmet), and a shield adorned with various designs. There do not seem to be any clear depictions of actual animals or humans on the label; the elements are stylized and represent heraldic imagery typically found in coats of arms. Regarding certainty, I would say I'm 1 (very certain) that there are no actual animals or humans depicted on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
