{"id":"167850964","responseA":"There are no animals or humans on this wine label. The label is textual with the mention of "Les Perrières," "Pommard," "Appellation Contrôlée," and "Vincent Dancer." There is a small artistic element to the right side, which appears to be a stylized drawing, but it does not represent a recognizable animal or human. I am very certain of this assessment—so on a scale of 0 to 1, my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
