{"id":"174643145","responseA":"There appear to be no animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The label features text indicating the name of the wine "Txakoli MOKOROA" and specifies "Cosecha 2011" which means "Harvest 2011" in Spanish. There is a small image above the main text that looks like a landscape or a building scene, common in winery symbols. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans in this image is 1, as the image is clear and there are no signs of creatures represented.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
