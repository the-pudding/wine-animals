{"id":"150365247","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that reads "Léon Beyer" along with "ALSACE Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée" and "PINOT GRIS." The label features an illustration of buildings, possibly representing architecture from the Alsace region. There are no animals or humans visible in this part of the label. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans in this section of the wine label is 1, as the illustration only contains buildings.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
