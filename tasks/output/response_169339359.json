{"id":"169339359","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that features text and decorative elements. The main text reads "Fossa Mala Chardonnay," indicating the brand and type of wine. Above the brand name, there appears to be a small emblem or logo, which seems to include a graphical design that could be interpreted as stylized or abstract but does not clearly depict an animal or a human figure. There are no images of animals or humans on this wine label. My certainty level regarding the absence of animals or humans in this image is 1, meaning I am very certain.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
