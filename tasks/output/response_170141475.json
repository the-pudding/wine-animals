{"id":"170141475","responseA":"The image displays a wine label called "Frida Kahlo Single Vineyard Red Blend." It features a stylized human-like depiction, which is a representation of a human face with orange flowers depicted above the forehead. Around the illustration, there are decorative elements that might be flowers and other ornamental graphics. There are no real animals or humans, nor any photographic representations of them in this image. My certainty level is 1, as the characteristics of the representation are clear and unambiguous.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
