{"id":"169056359","responseA":"The wine label features an illustration that appears to be abstract in nature, with shapes and colors that do not distinctly resemble any specific animals or humans. However, at the top of the label, there is a logo that contains the silhouette of a horse's head. There are no clear images of humans on the label. My certainty level regarding the presence of an animal (the horse in the logo) is 1 as it is clearly designed to represent that.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse","certainty": 1}"}
