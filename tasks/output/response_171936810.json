{"id":"171936810","responseA":"The image displays a wine label with the word "SOAVE" prominently featured, indicating the type of wine, which is a white Italian wine named after the region where it is produced. The label is for a bottle of Tamellini wine, which is indicated as a product of Italy. The artwork on the label includes human figures that appear to be in a classical or mythological style, reminiscent of grape harvesting scenes. I am quite certain (1) that the label depicts human figures, but no animals are discernible in this image. The label also provides other details such as the wine volume, alcohol content, and statutory warnings like "CONTIENE SOLFITI" (contains sulfites).","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
