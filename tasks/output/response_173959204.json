{"id":"173959204","responseA":"The image displays a wine label from a Sancerre wine. The label features graphic design elements, including text that provides information about the wine such as its appellation (Sancerre Protégé), the name (Florian Mollet), and the place of bottling (Verdigny, France). The central graphic appears to be a stylized emblem that could be interpreted as having the likeness of a person, possibly a historical figure or a symbolic representation, given the traditional attire and pattern. There are no clear animals depicted on it.On a scale of 0-1 for certainty regarding the presence of a person or animal, I would say 0 for animals as there are none distinctly presented, and close to 0.5 for a human figure due to the ambiguous and stylized representation that suggests it could be a person without explicitly confirming it as such.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.5}"}
