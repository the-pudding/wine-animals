{"id":"164586724","responseA":"I can see the image of a wine label, which reads "SCALUNERA ETNA BIANCO D.O.C." from the winery "TORRE MORA." The label features artwork, but there are no animals or humans depicted on it. It looks like an abstract representation of a mountain, which might be Mount Etna, considering the name of the wine. My certainty level about this observation is 1, as I can clearly see the elements in the label without any ambiguity in this context.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
