{"id":"167833841","responseA":"There are no animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The label features text and a graphic design. The text "AMALAYA" is prominent at the top, followed by "Esperanza por un milagro" which translates to "Hope for a miracle." Below that it states "MALBEC BLEND" and "Salta, Argentina" along with the elevation "5,900 feet above sea level." The graphic design is a spiral motif centered above the text. I am very certain of this (1 on the scale of certainty) because this analysis is based on the visible content of the image provided.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
