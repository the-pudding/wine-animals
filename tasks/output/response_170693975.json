{"id":"170693975","responseA":"I can see that there are graphical elements that might be interpreted as fish on the bottom left side of the wine label. These are not actual photographs or detailed images of animals but rather stylized representations or silhouettes. My certainty level that these silhouettes are intended to represent fish is relatively high, so I would rate it as a 1. There are no humans or other animals depicted on the label.","responseB":"{  "animal": "fish",  "certainty": 1}"}
