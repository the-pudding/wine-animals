{"id":"160098523","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans on the wine label. It features text that says "Willamette Valley Vineyards" and "Estate Willamette Valley - Pinot Noir." There is also a small emblem or logo, but it doesn't appear to have any images of animals or humans. I am very certain about this, so on a scale of 0-1, I would say 1 for certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
