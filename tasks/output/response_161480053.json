{"id":"161480053","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the name "CAVALLI TENUTA DEGLI DEI." At the top of the label, there appears to be a stylized emblem or crest which could be interpreted to contain an animal motif, possibly a horse or a similar figure given the name "Cavalli" (which means "horses" in Italian). I am approximately 0.8 certain that this could be an artistic representation of an animal on the emblem. However, without a clearer or more detailed view, this cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty.","responseB":"{"animal": "horse", "certainty": 0.8}"}
