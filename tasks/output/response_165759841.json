{"id":"165759841","responseA":"The image shows a wine label with the words "Domaine Serene," "RÃ©colte," "Grand Cru Chardonnay," and it indicates that the wine is from Dundee Hills, Oregon. I don't see any images of actual animals or humans. There is a graphic depiction of what appears to be a bird within a wreath at the center top of the label. This is not a real animal but a stylized representation, likely part of the brand's logo. I cannot give certainty scores, but I can assure you that there are no real animals or humans visible in this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 0.9}"}
