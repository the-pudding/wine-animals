{"id":"170420550","responseA":"The image shows a wine label for a bottle of Lunae, a Vermentino from the Colli di Luni DOC. The label is elegantly designed with a mix of textual and artistic elements. There is a small illustration within a decorative border at the top of the label that appears to feature a human face and some stars, which could be symbolic or representative of an emblem or crest. I am very certain (1) that there is an illustration of a face, which can be considered a representation of a human, on the label. There are no apparent animals on this label based on the provided image.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
