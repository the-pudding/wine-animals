{"id":"148691147","responseA":"There do not appear to be any animals or humans on this wine label â€“ it features an illustration of a chateau with trees and a clear sky. The main elements are the name of the wine, "Chateau La Croix Pomerol," and other text related to the wine's origin and producer. I am very certain of this assessment; on a scale from 0-1, I would say 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none","certainty": 1}"}
