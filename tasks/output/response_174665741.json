{"id":"174665741","responseA":"The image shows a wine label that does not contain any animals or humans. It is a wine from Bourgogne, specifically a MÃ¢con-Villages, and the label reads "Le Chai Duchet." The design is simple and does not depict any creatures, only text and some graphic elements like a design that looks like a stylized letter and two bunches of grapes or leaves representing the wine's origin. I'm very certain about my assessment, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say my certainty is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
