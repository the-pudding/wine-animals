{"id":"3775522","responseA":"The image depicts a wine label with the name "le fioraie" and the designation "chianti classico Riserva", indicating that it is a reserved quality of Chianti Classico wine. On the label, there are three stylized human figures with red flowers above their heads. These figures appear to be a decorative element rather than realistic representations of people. I am very certain that these are artistic representations of humans and not actual people or animals on the label; on the scale you provided, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
