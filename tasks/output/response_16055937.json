{"id":"16055937","responseA":"The label features a coat of arms with an heraldic lion included in the design. This is a common element in heraldry, used to symbolize bravery and nobility. There are no real animals or humans depicted on the label. Regarding the certainty of what is depicted, I would say I'm 1, or very certain, since it's clear that the lion is a designed element on a wine label, not an actual living creature.","responseB":"{"animal": "lion","certainty": 1}"}
