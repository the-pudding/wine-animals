{"id":"156477229","responseA":"The image displays a wine bottle with a label that features a black-and-white photograph. The main focus of the label is text: the wine's brand name "MONTSECANO," the grape variety "Pinot Noir," origin "D.O. Valle de Casablanca Chile," and vintage "2010." There is a photo within the label which appears to be of wine barrels and there seem to be ghostly figures or reflections in the background, which could be interpreted as human shapes, but they are indistinct and primarily part of the background scenery. I cannot confirm without ambiguity whether they are indeed humans or any other subject due to the small and blurry representation. My certainty level on the presence of humans or animals in this part of the image is about 0.5, as the image is not clear enough to make a definite statement.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 0.5}"}
