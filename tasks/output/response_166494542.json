{"id":"166494542","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is largely textual with the brand name "PENCE" prominently displayed along with the type of wine, "CHARDONNAY", and the region "Santa Barbara, California". There is also an illustration of a landscape, which appears to be a vineyard, indicating the agricultural origin of the wine. No animals or humans are depicted in this illustration. My certainty level would be 1, meaning I am very certain that there are no animals or humans on this wine label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
