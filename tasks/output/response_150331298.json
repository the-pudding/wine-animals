{"id":"150331298","responseA":"Based on the image provided, it appears to be a close-up of a wine bottle label from the brand "Varvaglione," specifically the "Papale - Primitivo di Manduria." There are no visible animals or humans depicted on the label. My certainty level is 1 – very certain – as the picture clearly shows the label with text and some decorative elements, but no representations of animals or humans.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
