{"id":"1615942","responseA":"I do not see any distinct images of animals or humans on this wine label. The label seems to be adorned with ornate, decorative elements that are typical for vintage or classical wine bottle designs. The intricate patterns seem to be mostly floral and decorative scrolls without clear representations of animals or humans.Given the stylistic elements present, I am very certain, so I would rate my certainty as 1, that there are no clear images of animals or humans on this label.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
