{"id":"175225937","responseA":"The image on the wine label features a palm tree, what appears to be a setting sun behind it, and some flora, including a red flower which might be a tropical species such as a ginger flower. There are also clouds in the sky and an object on the right that could be a representation of a coconut or a container. I do not see any animals or humans on the label. I am very certain of my observation, so on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be at 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
