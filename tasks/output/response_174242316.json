{"id":"174242316","responseA":"The image shows a bottle of wine with a label that reads "TOKARA", indicating the brand, and "SAUVIGNON BLANC" which is the type of wine. It is noted to be produced and bottled by Tokara in Stellenbosch, a wine region in South Africa. The label features an emblem or crest with intricate design elements but does not show any clear, identifiable animals or humans on it. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain about my assessment of this image.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
