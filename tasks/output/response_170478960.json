{"id":"170478960","responseA":"The image appears to show a wine bottle with a label that features an abstract or stylized depiction of a bird. The bird seems to be made up of various shapes and possibly words or letters, giving it a collage-like appearance.Since the depiction of the bird is a constructed design rather than a photograph or realistic drawing of an actual animal, my certainty that this image represents the concept of a bird (in this artistic, symbolic manner) is 1. However, I should clarify that this certainty is about the representation within this specific context (a designed label), not an assertion of the bird being a real, physical animal.","responseB":"{  "animal": "bird",  "certainty": 1}"}
