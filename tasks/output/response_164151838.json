{"id":"164151838","responseA":"The image on the wine label appears to be a relief or sculpture of a human-like face with flowing hair or foliage, probably reminiscent of the Greek mythological figure Medusa or a Bacchus/Dionysus representation, which is often associated with wine and vines. There are no actual animals or living humans on the label. My certainty level is 1, as I am very certain of my interpretation based on the visual evidence provided.","responseB":"{  "animal": "none",  "certainty": 1}"}
