{"id":"175155241","responseA":"I do not see any animals or humans on this wine label. The label is for "Puligny-Montrachet" and it includes the appellation "Puligny Montrachet contrôlée" and the name "Didier Delagrange". The small symbol on the label does not clearly represent an animal or a human, but rather it seems to be a graphic design or a logo. I am very certain of my assessment, with a certainty of 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
