{"id":"171859676","responseA":"The image on the wine label shows a stylized representation that could be interpreted as an abstract human-like figure due to the shape that resembles a profile of a face and shoulders. However, since it's a highly stylized design, it lacks clear and definitive human characteristics and it could also be seen as a non-representational form. Given the abstract nature, I would say my certainty is at 0.5 in regards to whether it represents a human or not, as interpretations may vary.","responseB":"{  "animal": "human",  "certainty": 0.5}"}
