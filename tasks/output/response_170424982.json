{"id":"170424982","responseA":"I don't see any animals or humans depicted on this wine label. The label features text (including the brand name "Santa Margherita" and the type of wine which is "Pinot Grigio"), decorative elements, and a drawing of a building which appears to be a villa or some sort of estate, suggesting a sense of heritage or origin related to the wine. I am very certain about this; on a scale from 0 to 1, my certainty would be 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "none", "certainty": 1}"}
