{"id":"161010736","responseA":"I can see that there is an incredibly small image that appears to be an animal on the label, roughly at the top center. Given the size and lack of detail, it is difficult to make out, but it looks like it could be a bird. However, due to the resolution and size, I cannot be completely certain about this observation. My certainty level in this case would be approximately 0.5, as there's some ambiguity due to the image's size and clarity.","responseB":"{"animal": "bird","certainty": 0.5}"}
