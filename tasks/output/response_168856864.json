{"id":"168856864","responseA":"The image shows a close-up of a wine bottle label, specifically for "Beaune Clos des Ursules". At the top of the label, there is an illustration that appears to be a face or a bust, possibly representing a human figure such as a person or a character. It is common for wine labels to feature artistic elements, including depictions of humans, animals, or symbols. Regarding the presence of animals or humans, we can say there is a depiction of a human-like figure (or face) on the label. I am very certain that this figure represents a human as it is a common graphic representation used for aesthetic or branding purposes. My certainty level is 1.","responseB":"{"animal": "human", "certainty": 1}"}
