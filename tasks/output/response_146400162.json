{"id":"146400162","responseA":"There appears to be an animal motif on the label; it looks like a fish with wings, which aligns with the name "flying fish cove" on the label. This suggests the presence of an animal element in the design. I am certain it's an animal depiction, so on a scale from 0 to 1, I would say 1 for certainty in this context.","responseB":"{"animal": "flying fish","certainty": 1}"}
